# miniprojects
A collection of personal miniprojects, feel free to contribute.

## ForwardForward

Implementation of Forward Forward algorithm described in https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/FFA13.pdf

### TODO

Figure out more accurate representation of algorithm, unsure if the program is actually implementing it despite promising preliminary results.

## InterestingDistributions

A collection of probability distributions that I've come across.

### TODO

Figure out distribution to use as prior for probabilistic convex/non-convex hull through Hidden Markov Model.

## Edge Detection

Currently, just a sobel edge detector

### TODO

Derive emission probabilities for a pixel being an edge given various filters.

## kaggles

Kaggle notebooks

## kernelnetworks

Feature engineering through repeated kernel method application. For example, applying rbf on a rbf kernel. Produces interesting regressors and classifiers.

### TODO

Figure out how to more accurately select subset of points for classifier, currently using kmeans++ initialization

Figure out how to use more than 2 applications of rbf and combat Runges Phenomon for extrapolation.

## minvocab

Looking at classifiers that output binary labels. Each node corresponding to a 1 or 0 through a modification of the sigmoid function. 

### TODO

If assigned binary labels MNIST labels take up 4 bits. 4 bits can represent 16 different states. Is there a way to boost classifier performance through mapping labels to more than one binary label? How do you train a machine that does that?

## misc articles

Title,

## OLS_Article

Notebooks concerning the derivation and optimization of Ordinary Least Squares problems.

### TODO

Get ready to put on medium or something.

## repeated_inner_outer_products

Title

### TODO

Maybe some kind of generative art?

## RotLogRegr

Logistic regression where line is determined through rotation.

### TODO

How do you extrapolate this to higher dimensions?
