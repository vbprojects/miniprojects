This evidence stands uncontroverted \\n\\nby any Defence witnesses.    As instructed by the Chamber, the Prosecution will not \\n\\nrepeat the submissions in its closing brief, but rather focus on responding to the \\n\\nDefence\\'s arguments and case theory, to the extent that the latter can be discerned \\n\\nfrom the Defence brief.     \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 2   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 3/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nYour Honour, the Defence brief adopts a flawed approach to the assessment of \\n\\nevidence.    It indulges in a piecemeal examination of individual witnesses and \\n\\ndocuments, but ignores the combined effect of the damning and mutually \\n\\ncorroborating body of incriminating evidence.    Stripped of its rhetoric and hyperbole, \\n\\nthe Defence brief essentially invites the Chamber to: (i) reject Prosecution witnesses\\' \\n\\nevidence - in totality - on the basis of exaggerated past credibility issues; (ii) to ignore \\n\\na significant body of corroborating evidence; and (iii) to buy into speculative \\n\\nconspiracy theories, unsupported by any acceptable evidence.     \\n\\nFinally, the Defence brief deflects from the real issues by raising imaginary or \\n\\nirrelevant criticisms of the Prosecution\\'s investigation and witness preparation \\n\\nsessions.    However, none of this detracts from the compelling evidence that is before \\n\\nthe Chamber. \\n\\nIn sum, the Defence criticisms may be grouped under several well-worn defence \\n\\ntropes:    (i) the Prosecution witnesses are liars; (ii) my client was framed; (iii) it\\'s all \\n\\na conspiracy; and (iv) if only the Prosecution had or had not done X, Y or Z, then my \\n\\nclient\\'s innocence would have been revealed.    None of these arguments, \\n\\nyour Honour, disturb the conclusion that the Prosecution has proved its case beyond \\n\\nreasonable doubt. \\n\\nI do not propose to respond to the Defence\\'s arguments on the individual witnesses, \\n\\ncharges or modes of liability, since these have already been addressed in detail in the \\n\\nProsecution closing brief.    Nor will I respond to the intemperate language of the \\n\\nDefence brief, other than to observe that the tone of the rhetoric is often inversely \\n\\nproportional to the substance of the submissions.    Rather, I will address certain \\n\\nthemes raised in the Defence brief and the logical and evidential flaws in the \\n\\nDefence\\'s theory. \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 3   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 4/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nAt the outset, however, it bears repeating that the Chamber is essentially faced with \\n\\na binary choice.    Either the witnesses and evidence presented by the Prosecution are \\n\\ntrue and correct in their essential features and Mr Gicheru is indeed guilty as charged, \\n\\nor else he has been the victim of a grand conspiracy of breathtaking scope, intricacy \\n\\nand duration.    There is no middle ground.    There is no innocent explanation \\n\\nconsistent with the Prosecution\\'s evidence, and none has been suggested by the \\n\\nDefence.    If the Chamber accepts the Prosecution evidence, it must return a verdict \\n\\nof guilty on all eight counts of corrupt influence, contrary to Article 70(1)(c) of the \\n\\nStatute.     \\n\\nBefore proceeding further, however, I would like to propose that rather than reading \\n\\nall of the references to the briefs and to underlying evidence in full, with the leave of \\n\\nthe Chamber and the permission of my learned friend, I have provided copies of my \\n\\nreading notes to the Chamber that contain the complete references. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:42:47] Thank you. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [9:42:50] I will not have to tax the transcribers then with -- with \\n\\nthat. \\n\\nI\\'d like to start, your Honour, by making a few submissions on the Defence\\'s legal \\n\\napproach to the assessment of evidence and the standard of proof.   \\n\\nStarting with the Defence approach to the standard of proof, the Defence statement of \\n\\nthe \"beyond reasonable doubt\" standard is by and large correct, your Honour, but it \\n\\nintroduces an element of imprecision by the insertion of the word \"material\" in its \\n\\nrecap of the Appeals Chamber\\'s dictum in the Bemba appeal.    This reads in its \\n\\noriginal form as follows, quote:   \\n\\n\"[...] the trial chamber is required to make findings of fact to the standard of proof \\n\\n\\'beyond reasonable doubt\\' only in relation to those facts -- \" \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 4   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 5/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nAnd not those material facts as stated by the Defence --   \\n\\n\"only in relation to those facts that correspond to the elements of the crime and mode \\n\\nof liability of the accused as charged\".     \\n\\nWhy is this significant, your Honour?    It is because the term \"material facts\" is \\n\\ncommonly used in a broader sense to refer to those facts that the Prosecution must \\n\\nplead in its DCC in order to give the Defence sufficient notice of the case that it \\n\\nintends to present.    But such material facts may extend beyond the essential facts \\n\\nnecessary to prove elements of the offence and the applicable modes of liability.    The \\n\\nProsecution\\'s submission, your Honour, is that the jurisprudence of the Court makes \\n\\nit clear that it\\'s only the latter facts and not the former that must be proved beyond \\n\\nreasonable doubt.     \\n\\nFor this reason the Prosecution submits that the formulation at paragraph 15 of the \\n\\nProsecution\\'s closing brief is a more accurate expression of the law. \\n\\nTHE INTERPRETER:    [9:44:46] From the English booth:    Could counsel please be \\n\\nrequested to slow down for the purposes of interpretation.    Thank you.       \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [9:44:50](Overlapping speakers) Turning to the issue of \\n\\ninferential reasoning.     \\n\\nOnce again, the Defence\\'s formulation for the test for inferential reasoning is also \\n\\ncorrect, but only insofar as the fact sought to be inferred is a fact requiring proof \\n\\nbeyond reasonable doubt, as just discussed.    It follows that not every underlying or \\n\\nintermediate fact needs to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, and for this reason \\n\\nsuch facts do not have to meet the inferential reasoning test outlined by the Defence.   \\n\\nI refer in this regard to paragraph 15 and footnote 30 of the Prosecution\\'s closing brief.   \\n\\nAs previously mentioned, the Defence adopts a piecemeal approach to the assessment \\n\\nof evidence.    While the Defence brief pays lip service to the need for an holistic \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 5   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 6/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nassessment of evidence, in practice it does the opposite.    Each witness and each piece \\n\\nof evidence is assessed in isolation, declared unreliable or incapable of belief, and \\n\\nthen rejected outright.    When addressing corroboration, other evidence deemed \\n\\nunacceptable through the same myopic approach is simply ignored.    At no point \\n\\ndoes the Defence step back and assess the impact of the evidence in its totality.     \\n\\nHowever, your Honour, this is precisely how a court should not go about assessing \\n\\nevidence.    To the contrary, the Prosecution submits that the Chamber should be \\n\\nguided in its assessment of the evidence by the principles established in the consistent \\n\\nbody of jurisprudence of this Court, as set out in section A.I. of the Prosecution \\n\\nclosing brief, which I will not repeat. \\n\\nTHE INTERPRETER:    [9:46:29] Message from the interpretation booth:    Could a \\n\\nmember of the team of Mr --   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [9:46:30] (Overlapping speakers) Turning to the Defence\\'s use of \\n\\nthe term -- \\n\\nTHE INTERPRETER:    [9:46:30] -- of the Prosecutor please request that he slow down.   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [9:46:42](Overlapping speakers) -- \"hearsay\", your Honour, the \\n\\nDefence brief frequently attacks the Prosecution evidence as hearsay and invites the \\n\\nChamber to reject it on this basis.    In fact, the word \"hearsay\" is mentioned no fewer \\n\\nthan 123 times in the Defence brief.    However, aside from the fact that hearsay \\n\\nevidence is not inadmissible at this Court, the term is often applied to evidence that is \\n\\nnot in fact hearsay at all.     \\n\\nSo for instance, the brief describes as hearsay P-397\\'s evidence regarding his meetings \\n\\nand interactions with the accused.    But in fact, P-397 provides an account of evidence \\n\\nthat he personally witnessed and experienced, which is, in truth, direct evidence.    It \\n\\nis of course the case that P-397 is unavailable to testify for reasons which have been \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 6   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 7/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nwell ventilated before this Court, and the Prosecution is thus constrained to rely on \\n\\nhis prior recorded testimony under Rule 68(1)(c). \\n\\nI\\'m being told to slow down. \\n\\nBut that of course is an entirely different issue and one that the Chamber will consider \\n\\nin determining the weight of this evidence.    However, as set out in detail in the \\n\\nProsecution\\'s closing brief, P-397\\'s evidence is credible, consistent and corroborated in \\n\\nits essential features and should be accepted by the Chamber.    In weighing the \\n\\nreliability of the evidence, your Honour, the Chamber should also take into account \\n\\nthe accused\\'s false denial of his relationship with P-397, a point to which I will return \\n\\npresently. \\n\\nThe Defence also dismisses as hearsay the recordings and evidence of witnesses \\n\\nconcerning their conversations with intermediaries and associates when, in truth, \\n\\nonly a small portion of these conversations can properly be labelled as hearsay.     \\n\\nFor instance, at paragraph 87 of the Defence brief, P-800\\'s evidence that Barasa called \\n\\nhim and stated that he, Barasa, had accepted a bribe and asked P-800 to do the same is \\n\\nreferred to as hearsay.    But this is, in fact, direct evidence of these events and the fact \\n\\nthat this conversation was not recorded does not make it hearsay.    By the same token, \\n\\nthe various statements of intermediaries and associates aimed at corruptly influencing \\n\\nthe witnesses constitutes direct evidence of the actus reus of corrupt influence.    And \\n\\nevidence of intermediaries persuading the witnesses who agreed to withdraw to \\n\\ncome back to Kenya and to meet with Mr Gicheru provides direct evidence of the \\n\\nexistence and operation of the common plan.    Only in those few narrow instances \\n\\nwhere the perpetrators state that Mr Gicheru did X or said Y can the evidence \\n\\nproperly be labelled as hearsay. \\n\\nBut, your Honour, even then the Chamber may rely on this evidence.    The \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 7   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 8/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nAppeals Chamber in the Bemba et al. appeal rejected Defence arguments that the \\n\\nTrial Chamber had erred in relying on \"remote and untested hearsay\" in the form of \\n\\nintercepted communications.    The Appeals Chamber found that the interaction \\n\\nbetween other members of the common plan that was reflected in the intercepted \\n\\ncommunications, quote: \\n\\n\"[...] shows that Mr Bemba\\'s co-perpetrators acted under the common understanding \\n\\nthat Mr Bemba was involved in the scheme of illicit witness coaching and gave \\n\\ninstructions regarding the expected testimony.\" unquote.     \\n\\nSo too in the present case, the OPC recordings demonstrate that Barasa, Bett, Yebei, \\n\\nand P-495, all acted with the common understanding that Mr Gicheru was the person \\n\\nto whom targeted witnesses were to be brought to negotiate and receive their bribes. \\n\\nSo I invite the Chamber to examine critically the Defence\\'s assertions regarding \\n\\nhearsay evidence.    But to the extent that certain evidence may be correctly labelled as \\n\\nhearsay, it may still, where appropriate, be relied upon by the Chamber, as set out in \\n\\nthe Prosecution\\'s closing brief.    Particularly, your Honour, for corroboration or to \\n\\nestablish peripheral or intermediate facts not requiring proof beyond reasonable \\n\\ndoubt.     \\n\\nI move on then, your Honour, to the Defence\\'s approach to the credibility of \\n\\nProsecution witnesses.     \\n\\nIt is no surprise that certain Prosecution witnesses had credibility issues and had at \\n\\nsome point told lies, including under oath.    This is, after all, a corruption case.   \\n\\nProsecution witnesses were bribed and intimidated into agreeing to sign recanting \\n\\naffidavits - making fabricated allegations against the Prosecution and other \\n\\nwitness - and to provide false evidence in the Ruto and Sang case.    It is for this very \\n\\nreason that the Prosecution went to such great lengths to obtain objective \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 8   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 9/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\ncorroboration for the witnesses\\' evidence, such as recording of approaches by \\n\\nperpetrators, bank records, communication data and so forth, as explained by lead \\n\\ninvestigator P-730. \\n\\nFor the most part, the corrupted witnesses readily admitted those lies once the \\n\\ninfluence of the accused and associates was removed.    However, the corrosive effects \\n\\nof corrupt influence was more pervasive in others and some witnesses \\n\\nwere - unsurprisingly - embarrassed or scared to admit the full extent of their \\n\\nwrongdoing.    So for instance, P-800 was initially reluctant to implicate his friend as \\n\\nthe person who took him to meet the accused, but later came clean as trust was \\n\\nestablished.    And while P-516 admitted - very reluctantly - to receiving payments \\n\\nfrom Mr Gicheru to withdraw as a Prosecution witness, he steadfastly refused to \\n\\nconcede that he had lied in other aspects of his evidence in the Ruto and Sang case. \\n\\nThe Defence relies on these and other credibility issues, real or imagined, to argue \\n\\nthat the evidence of all the Prosecution fact witnesses, excluding P-738, must be \\n\\nrejected lock, stock and barrel.    However, this approach ignores the jurisprudence of \\n\\nthe Bemba et al. Trial Chamber, confirmed on appeal, that, quote: \\n\\n\"[...] no witness is per se unreliable, including a witness that has previously given false \\n\\ntestimony before a court.    Instead, each statement made by a witness must be \\n\\nassessed individually.    The testimony of one and the same witness may therefore be \\n\\nreliable in one part, but not reliable in another.\" \\n\\nWhile the testimony of such witnesses should be approached with caution and the \\n\\npresence or absence of corroboration will be an important consideration, a far more \\n\\nnuanced and reasoned analysis of the witnesses\\' testimony than that performed by \\n\\nthe Defence is required, particularly in a case of this nature.    Ultimately, the question \\n\\nthat the Chamber must answer is not whether or not the witnesses have lied in the \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 9   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 10/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\npast, but whether or not they were lying when they testified before this Chamber that \\n\\nthey were corruptly influenced by the accused and his associates.     \\n\\nAlthough I promised not to react to the criticism of each witness, I am constrained to \\n\\nobserve that many of the Defence\\'s criticisms of the witnesses\\' testimonies before this \\n\\nChamber are based on exaggerated or imagined inconsistencies, which are then \\n\\ncharacterised as, quote, \"lies under oath\".    Unquote.     \\n\\nSo for instance, the Defence incorrectly claims at paragraph 61 of the brief and \\n\\nfootnote 356 that P-613, quote, \"testified that she lied to the VWU because she was \\n\\nbored and lonely\".    Unquote.    However, an examination of the testimony cited \\n\\nreveals that she made no such admission.     \\n\\nSimilarly, the Defence accuses P-800 of lying under oath about whether or not he was \\n\\npermitted to contact other OTP witnesses, based on a supposed contradiction \\n\\nbetween pages 33 and 53 of transcript 52.    But this is based on a misinterpretation or, \\n\\nat best, selective interpretation of his evidence.    The Defence claims at paragraph 80 \\n\\nof their brief that P-800 testified that he was, quote, \"permitted\", unquote, to contact \\n\\nother witnesses.    What the witness actually said was, quote: \\n\\n\"I explained that, due to the fact that we were coming from the same and we knew \\n\\nwhere we -- we were, at times [...] we could speak without permission.\"    Unquote.     \\n\\n\"We could speak without permission.\"    In context, what the witness was saying, I \\n\\nsubmit, is that they would sometimes speak to other witnesses despite not having \\n\\npermission, but he did not claim that he was actually permitted to do so.    These are \\n\\nbut two examples, and I invite the Chamber to examine, for instance, the Defence\\'s \\n\\nclaims at paragraph 150, footnotes 882 to 885, and paragraph 115, footnotes 673 to 674.     \\n\\nYour Honour, many other assertions by the Defence brief are also based on strained \\n\\nor cynical interpretations of the evidence, but I trust the Chamber will draw its own \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 10   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 11/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nconclusions when reviewing the underlying material.     \\n\\nI move on now to the issue of corroborating evidence. \\n\\nThe Defence attacks the items of corroborative evidence relied on by the Prosecution \\n\\non an individual basis, but fails to consider the holistic effect of this evidence.    So the \\n\\nDefence points out - correctly - that the bank records of 397 and 341 do not in \\n\\nthemselves prove conclusively that the source of the huge cash deposits was the \\n\\naccused.    But the Defence fails to consider that the mere fact that not just one, but \\n\\ntwo, of the corrupted witnesses both came into huge amounts of money - way beyond \\n\\ntheir previous means - at the precise time they were allegedly being targeted by the \\n\\naccused and his associates, has, in itself, significant corroborative value.    I digress to \\n\\npoint out, however, that the very reason why the witnesses were all paid in cash was \\n\\nprecisely to avoid leaving a paper trail connecting them to Mr Gicheru.    This was \\n\\nexplained to the witnesses by the accused himself, as well as his associates.    And I \\n\\nrefer your Honour to the references in footnote 190 of the Prosecution\\'s trial brief. \\n\\nThe Defence\\'s alternative theories for these deposits are entirely speculative.    The \\n\\nDefence hypothesises that P-397\\'s deposits might have been the proceeds from the \\n\\nsale of a plot of land.    But the only evidence of this, in the form of an investigation \\n\\nreport, reveals that as of 7 May 2013, P-397 had not yet found a buyer for his farm.   \\n\\nThis is a week after the money was deposited in his account.    And as regards P-341, \\n\\nthe Defence simply speculates that he might have \"sold property or acquired money \\n\\nfrom his 25 dependents\", unquote.    Apart from the fact that one does not normally \\n\\nreceive money from dependents - it\\'s normally the other way around, of course - but \\n\\nthere is no evidential basis whatsoever for this assumption. \\n\\nRegarding the Defence\\'s criticism of the reliability of the bank records, there are \\n\\nample indicia of reliability for both documents, and P-397\\'s deposits are also \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 11   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 12/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nconfirmed by contemporaneous SMS alerts from the bank, as is revealed in his \\n\\ntelephone data.    The fact that P-341 did not bring his bank statements in a sealed \\n\\nenvelope with a business card attached does not make them suspect, your Honour, as \\n\\nclaimed by the Defence.    These bank statements bear the witness\\'s name, the official \\n\\nstamp of the bank, and the signature of the branch manager, on each page.    The \\n\\nstatement is entirely regular on its face and there are no indications whatsoever of any \\n\\ntampering or manipulation, nor has the Defence identified any.    Furthermore, as to \\n\\nthe Defence\\'s criticism that the witness bank card number does not much the account \\n\\nnumber, there is no evidence to suggest that these numbers are necessarily the same, \\n\\nespecially in Kenya. \\n\\nTurning then to the telephone data produced by the Prosecution, the Defence argues \\n\\nthat this does not establish conclusively that the accused was in contact at the relevant \\n\\ntime with the relevant persons.    Again, while this is correct, the Defence does not \\n\\nconsider the implication of the fact that the accused - a person whom they say is \\n\\nallegedly selected at random to be the scapegoat of some grand conspiracy - is \\n\\npositively connected through the phone data to almost every significant actor \\n\\nimplicated by the witnesses as participating in the witness corruption scheme.     \\n\\nRemember, your Honour, that it is undisputed that the witnesses did not know \\n\\nMr Gicheru and had no dealings with him prior to these events, with the exception of \\n\\nP-397, whose relationship -- whose allegations of relationship the accused made I will \\n\\ndiscuss shortly.     \\n\\nHowever, how could these witnesses possibly have known in 2013, what the phone \\n\\ndata would subsequently reveal in 2021?    Was it just dumb luck?    Now one or two \\n\\noverlaps between the persons implicated by the witnesses and the phone data might \\n\\nbe dismissed as a coincidence, but there are no fewer than 10 common plan members \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 12   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 13/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nand associates and other persons of interest linked to the accused by the phone data.   \\n\\nThis includes managers Simatwo and Maiyo; intermediaries Barasa and Bett; \\n\\nassociates Busienei, P-495 and Kogo; as well as lawyers Njuguna and Mitei; and of \\n\\ncourse the ultimate beneficiary of the scheme, Mr William Ruto. \\n\\nI note in this regard that the Defence brief mistakenly alleges that the relevant contact \\n\\ndetails for Ruto were not contained in the phone data.    And this is at paragraph 188 \\n\\nof the Defence brief and footnote 1018.    However, this is incorrect, your Honour.   \\n\\nProper inspection of the record reveals that the number is in fact reflected in the \\n\\nrecords, and I refer the Chamber to KEN-OTP-0160-0043 at items 1766 to 1767.    I \\n\\ninvite my learned friend to withdraw that assertion. \\n\\nI must also respond to another repeated assertion in the Defence brief concerning the \\n\\ntelephone data, but I will have to do so in somewhat oblique terms since we are in \\n\\npublic session.    And that is the allegation that information establishing the \\n\\nconnection between the accused and the relevant persons I have just listed was, quote, \\n\\n\"inserted\", unquote, in 2018.    The implication being, I presume, that it did not exist \\n\\nprior to that.    However, clear inspection - closer inspection, I beg your pardon - will \\n\\nreveal that all the relevant data was created on exactly the same day at precisely the \\n\\nsame time, give or take one minute:    to be precise, 6 October 2018, between 07:26 and \\n\\n07:27 Universal Time. \\n\\nAnd not only those numbers, but hundreds of others too.    It would be physically \\n\\nimpossible to have inserted all these numbers manually and this can only have been \\n\\ninserted through importing the data from another device or a backup.    So while the \\n\\ninitial date of creation of the various entries cannot be determined from the phone \\n\\ndata, it was clearly not created for the first time on this date and must have existed \\n\\npreviously. \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 13   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 14/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nThis is also consistent with the report of the Forensic Science Section admitted under \\n\\nRule 68(2)(b), which concludes that the data in its present location was uploaded \\n\\nthrough restoring a previous backup. \\n\\nI turn then to the OPC recordings, one-party consent recordings. \\n\\nThe Defence has to date failed to provide any consistent or coherent theory explaining \\n\\nthe OPC recording evidence.    Perhaps my learned friend will finally provide an \\n\\nexplanation today for the first time, in which case I may be forced to seek leave to \\n\\nreply.     \\n\\nThe Prosecution has disclosed to the Defence no fewer than 117 different recorded \\n\\nconversations, 97 of which have been submitted into the record, together with their \\n\\nrelevant transcriptions and translations.    These conversations were recorded by \\n\\nP-738, P-613, P-800, P-495 and P-397 respectively from May 2013 to July 2014 and \\n\\ninvolve intermediaries and associates Yebei, Barasa, Bett, P-495 and the accused \\n\\nhimself. \\n\\nIf accepted, this body of evidence provides cogent proof of the existence and modus \\n\\noperandi of the witness interference scheme and the accused\\'s participation and role \\n\\ntherein.    It also strongly corroborates the evidence of Prosecution witnesses to this \\n\\neffect. \\n\\nAgainst this background, the Defence neglects to address the OPC recordings as \\n\\na body of evidence in its closing brief.    However, as best as can be gleaned from the \\n\\nDefence\\'s cross-examination, and from its analysis of the evidence of the Prosecution \\n\\nwitnesses, it appears to suggest that all of these recordings -- all of these recordings \\n\\nwere pre-scripted by one or more of the Prosecution witnesses, with the agreement \\n\\nand cooperation of the persons being recorded.    The allege purpose, it seems, was to \\n\\ncreate false evidence in support of bogus claims of witness interference in order to \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 14   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 15/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nreceive witness protection and the attendant benefits.    And for some reason, which is \\n\\nyet unexplained, they decided to inject the accused\\'s name into their false narrative as \\n\\nthe guiding hand behind the witness interference scheme.   \\n\\nApart from the fact that there is not a shred of acceptable evidence of any such \\n\\nagreement, this simply does not gel with the contents and tone of these recorded \\n\\nconversations.    Some of the recordings concern mundane matters or logistical \\n\\narrangements for proposed meetings, including some meetings that never happened.   \\n\\nAssociates clearly speak in guarded or coded languages and sometimes express \\n\\nreluctance to discuss matters on the phone. \\n\\nYour Honour, had the purpose been to manufacture evidence to implicate \\n\\nMr Gicheru as the person behind it, one would have expected to see a far more clear, \\n\\nexplicit and polished narrative and much less irrelevant chit-chat.    And this purpose \\n\\ncould have been served in one or two short and clear meetings without going to the \\n\\nextent of arranging face-to-face meetings.    In contrast, your Honour, the \\n\\ninterlocutors are quite careful for the most part not to mention Mr Gicheru\\'s name on \\n\\nthe phone, even though it is clear from the language and context that they are \\n\\nreferring to him.    The most explicit discussions of Mr Gicheru\\'s involvement and role \\n\\nare largely reserved for the face-to-face meetings with Barasa and 495 respectively, \\n\\nwhen presumably they thought they were safe from interception.     \\n\\nIt is also inconceivable, your Honour, that the intermediaries and associates would \\n\\ndeliberately incriminate themselves on record of serious criminal offences simply for \\n\\nthe benefit of the Prosecution witnesses. \\n\\nAnd in the case of Barasa and P-495, knowing that they had been recorded offering \\n\\nbribes to OTP witnesses and that these conversations would be handed to the \\n\\ninvestigators, it is absurd to suggest that they would then travel outside Kenya to \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 15   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 16/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nmeet with the witnesses and deliberately expose themselves to arrest.     \\n\\nAnd what of the OPC recordings between Barasa and P-738?    The Defence has not \\n\\nsuggested that this witness was involved in any conspiracy to falsely implicate the \\n\\naccused or to falsify evidence, and her credibility stands entirely unimpeached.    She \\n\\nwas not even cross-examined.    How are these calls to be explained, other than what \\n\\nthey clearly are, an increasingly desperate effort by Barasa to corruptly influence the \\n\\nwitness to return to Kenya and meet with Gicheru to receive her payments before \\n\\nleaving for The Hague to testify. \\n\\nYour Honours, this speculative theory simply defies all logic and belief and should be \\n\\nrejected by the Chamber as a reasonable possibility.   \\n\\nI turn then to the recorded call between P-397 and the accused. \\n\\nThe Defence\\'s explanation for the accused\\'s recorded conversation with P-397 is \\n\\nstrained and inconsistent with the contents and context of the calls.    The Defence \\n\\nasserts that in the face of statements by P-397 regarding the accused\\'s involvement in \\n\\nhis withdrawal as a Prosecution witness, the accused was, quote, \"non-responsive\", \\n\\nunquote.    As I will shortly demonstrate, this is not entirely correct.    But even to the \\n\\nextent that it is, this is in itself significant.    Unresponsiveness, in circumstances \\n\\nwhere a response would be expected from an innocent person, may be incriminating \\n\\nper se, particularly in the absence of any reasonable explanation.    As a lawyer \\n\\nhimself, the accused would have been well aware of this.     \\n\\nSo when the witness says to the accused, quote, \"Please figure out how you\\'re going \\n\\nto help me.    Because I agreed to withdraw from the ICC.    Now I\\'m in your hands ...\" \\n\\nunquote, the obvious response would be, \"What do you mean you agreed to \\n\\nwithdraw from the ICC?    What does this have to do with me?\"    And this is \\n\\nparticularly significant, your Honour, since in his interview under caution, \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 16   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 17/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nMr Gicheru denied knowing that P-397 was in fact an ICC witness.    If that were \\n\\nindeed true, I submit that it is inconceivable that this revelation would not prompt \\n\\na response.    Instead, the accused deflects by saying, quote, \"You know when those \\n\\npeople do their stupidity like that ...\" and then trails off, unquote.     \\n\\nHowever, on a another occasion, the Defence does respond and his response are \\n\\nsignificant.    When P-397 says to the accused, explicitly, quote: \\n\\n\"You are the one who had me return to you.    And you persuaded me, we spoke to \\n\\nyou together with Sila SIMATWA [sic], you told me, \\'My dear, you are one of our \\n\\npeople\\'.    I\\'ve come to you and now you start putting me in the bush again.\"   \\n\\nUnquote. \\n\\nAgain, no indignant denial or surprised query.    Rather, on this occasion, the \\n\\naccused\\'s response is to object that the witness has mentioned his name on the \\n\\ntelephone and that of Simatwo.    And when the witness complains that Simatwo has \\n\\nbeen avoiding him, Gicheru replies, quote: \\n\\n\"I don\\'t know where he is.

The Defence brief doesn\\'t even attempt to \\n\\ngrapple with this evidence.    Instead it complains that P-397 conversation -- sorry, \\n\\nthat P-397\\'s conversation was, quote, \"scripted\", unquote.    Apart from being \\n\\ninaccurate, as the verbatim record of the interview will attest, the obvious response is \\n\\n\"So what?\"    What would it matter if P-397\\'s words were entirely scripted?     \\n\\nWhat is important, your Honour, is the accused\\'s response, or lack thereof, as the case \\n\\nmay be.    No objection was raised by the Defence on this basis at the time the \\n\\nevidence was submitted and none is raised now.    Rather, the Defence again deflects \\n\\nwith red herrings, hinting darkly at prosecutorial misconduct, but failing to point out \\n\\nany specific consequences or request any remedy, a theme which permeates the \\n\\nDefence brief. \\n\\nI move on now to the accused\\'s interview under caution. \\n\\nThe brief also does not address the significant admissions made by the accused \\n\\nduring his interview with the OTP.    In particular, his transparent and evolving lies \\n\\nconcerning his relationship with P-397 and Yebei.    Although the Defence adopts the \\n\\naccused\\'s ultimate version that he represented P-397 in a land transaction, it does not \\n\\nacknowledge the fact that the accused initially categorically denied knowing him.   \\n\\nThen, when confronted with the recorded conversations with P-397, the accused at \\n\\nfirst claimed that he could not recognise his own voice.    He then conceded that it \\n\\nmust have been someone he was familiar with and that perhaps he was a client, but \\n\\nhe would need to check his office records.     \\n\\nSubsequently, the accused stated that he recalled the threats P-397 had received and \\n\\nremembered calling Busienei on his behalf.    Finally, he came up with a version that \\n\\nhe had acted for P-397 in a land matter and gave evermore detailed descriptions of \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 18   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 19/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nthe transaction.    All the references, your Honour, are in the speaking notes. \\n\\nYour Honour, the accused also admitted having read about P-397\\'s disappearance in \\n\\nthe newspapers, despite previously claiming that he did not read the newspapers \\n\\nwhen asked about Yebei\\'s disappearance.    While the Defence now wants the \\n\\nChamber to accept the accused\\'s final version that P-397 was a legitimate client, it \\n\\nfailed to produce any of the records Mr Gicheru claimed to have at his office, which \\n\\ncould easily have established a genuine attorney-client relationship if this were true.   \\n\\nLand transactions typically produce lots of -- lots of paper in my experience. \\n\\nYour Honour, I submit that the accused\\'s evasiveness and dissembling concerning his \\n\\nrelationship with P-397 is a clear indication that their relationship was not in fact \\n\\na legitimate business relationship, but rather one based on corruption, as P-397 \\n\\nalleges. \\n\\nSimilarly, the accused\\'s developing story regarding his relationship with Yebei is even \\n\\nmore transparently false in my submission.    Time prevents me from recounting the \\n\\nevolution of his story from categorically denying having heard the name Yebei, to \\n\\nadmitting that he knew him as an ICC witness, and finally conceding that Yebei had \\n\\nbeen to his office on several occasions, while maintaining that he merely accompanied \\n\\nGicheru\\'s client P-15, for no apparent reason.    He then also recalled that he had, in \\n\\nfact, been interviewed by the Kenyan police concerning the disappearance of this \\n\\nperson.    A fact that I imagine would have been hard not to remember.     \\n\\nIn weighing whether it is reasonably possible that the accused was falsely implicated \\n\\nby the witnesses or whether he was indeed involved in a corrupt relationship with \\n\\nthem, in concert with his common plan associates, his lies about his relationship with \\n\\na corrupted witness and an alleged intermediary weigh heavily in favour of the latter, \\n\\nyour Honour.   \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 19   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 20/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nThe Defence conspiracy theory, \"My client was framed.\"   \\n\\nThe Defence asks the Court to accept as a reasonable possibility that his client was \\n\\nframed by eight separate witnesses.    But this theory is so riddled with \\n\\ninconsistencies and improbabilities, in the absence of any acceptable evidential basis, \\n\\nit amounts to nothing more than fanciful speculation and wishful thinking.     \\n\\nFirstly, the evidence of eight Prosecution witnesses implicating the accused and his \\n\\nassociates is too voluminous and too consistent for this to have been a coincidence, in \\n\\nthe sense that these witnesses independently decided to falsely incriminate the same \\n\\nperson or persons.     \\n\\nNo, if the accused were framed, this could only have been the product of a grand \\n\\nconspiracy.    This conspiracy would require at least seven of the eight Prosecution \\n\\nwitnesses who implicated the accused - all but P-738 - to not -- to not -- have not only \\n\\ncommunicated, but agreed amongst each other to falsify evidence of witness \\n\\ninterference and to falsely implicate the accused, as well as various members of his \\n\\ncommon plan, such as, Simatwo, Maiyo, Busienei and various common plan \\n\\nintermediaries.    They must have compared notes and agreed to replicate the same \\n\\nmodus operandi in their accounts.    And they must have persisted with this \\n\\nconspiracy over a period spanning nine years and while located in different countries \\n\\nin East Africa and, later, the world. \\n\\nThe Defence fails to provide any credible explanation as to why the accused would \\n\\nhave been selected as the target for the alleged conspiracy.    None of the witnesses \\n\\ntestified to having any prior dealings or relationships with Mr Gicheru, or any reason \\n\\nto hold a grudge against him.    Nor has Defence presented or identified any evidence \\n\\nto this effect, with the exception of the evidence of the accused\\'s unsworn and \\n\\nevolving self-serving claim that P-397 was a client in a land transaction, which I have \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 20   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 21/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\njust mentioned.    The only reason put forward by the Defence was the fact that the \\n\\naccused had represented P-15 in his withdrawal as a Prosecution witness.    But this \\n\\nremains entirely speculative.    I observe that a more obvious target would have been \\n\\none of the counsel directly involved in the Ruto and Sang case. \\n\\nSecondly, the alleged purpose of this grand conspiracy, namely to obtain benefits and \\n\\nrelocation out of Africa to a First World country, quote-unquote, does not stand up to \\n\\nscrutiny.    To start with, the Defence narrative is based on a false, and frankly \\n\\ninsulting, assumption that every African wants nothing more than to leave Africa and \\n\\nmove to Europe or America or some other developed country.    And the alleged \\n\\nbenefits of entering a witness protection programme are exaggerated, while the \\n\\ncosts - financial, social and emotional - are ignored.   \\n\\nAs regards the benefits, it is significant that while the schedules of OTP witness \\n\\nexpenses were disclosed for each of the Prosecution witnesses, only one was used in \\n\\ncross-examination and tendered into evidence, that for P-613.    This then is the high \\n\\nwater mark of evidence of the alleged benefits that supposedly prompted this \\n\\nconspiracy.     \\n\\nBut the schedule of benefits for P-613 reveals that, apart from covering her upkeep \\n\\nand necessary expenses, including her children\\'s school fees, she benefited to the tune \\n\\nof $30 a month, or less than $1 a day; a paltry sum to commit perjury for.    Although \\n\\nwe know that most of the witnesses were subsequently admitted into witness \\n\\nprotection by the VWU - the independent unit of the Registry responsible for the \\n\\nprotection of both Prosecution and Defence witnesses - apart from this one benefit \\n\\nschedule, there is actually no evidence on record that the witnesses have in fact \\n\\nbenefited, apart from the condescending assumption that if they are outside of Africa, \\n\\nthey must necessarily be better off.     \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 21   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 22/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nAnd the Defence ignores the costs of relocation, the costs to the witnesses.    Witnesses \\n\\nwho were relocated and accepted into the witness protection programme had to give \\n\\nup their careers, their sources of income, and were totally dependent on the Court for \\n\\ntheir very existence, including accommodation, food and education for their children.   \\n\\nI pause to add that none of these witnesses were previously indigent or uneducated.   \\n\\nAll had jobs and were able to provide for themselves and their families prior to \\n\\nbecoming OTP witnesses.    They were then removed from their extended families \\n\\nand communities and moved to strange countries, where they sometimes did not \\n\\nspeak the language and had absolutely no support network.     \\n\\nThe Chamber has heard evidence on how several of these witnesses struggled to \\n\\nadapt and how language and education issues were problematic.    The travails of \\n\\nP-274 and P-739 were particularly harrowing to hear.    But P-516, P-738, P-613 and \\n\\nP-800 all experienced difficulties too.    Naturally, they cried out for better conditions, \\n\\nand they cannot be faulted for doing so.    However, despite all of this, the Defence \\n\\nwould have the Chamber accept - as a reasonable possibility - that the expected \\n\\nbenefits -- the expectation of benefits and relocation were sufficient to prompt these \\n\\nwitnesses to conspire to falsely implicate the accused.    Despite having experienced \\n\\nthe realities of witness protection and relocation, and despite having nothing further \\n\\nto gain in most cases, the witnesses still came to Court and continued to propagate \\n\\nthis supposed false narrative under oath. \\n\\nThirdly, this theory disregards the real and present security risks faced by \\n\\nProsecution witnesses in this case -- in this situation.    These were not just imagined.   \\n\\nTestifying at the ICC in the Kenya situation carried real danger and witness \\n\\nprotection was a necessity, not a luxury.    As already alluded to, the Prosecution \\n\\nwitnesses within Kenya faced intense and unyielding pressure and intimidation, in \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 22   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 23/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nsome cases actual violence.    Sometimes with fatal consequences.    The evidence of \\n\\nwitness interference from the witnesses in this case is but a fraction of the reported \\n\\nincidents of witness interference in the Ruto and Sang case, as outlined in the DCC. \\n\\nThis is also a matter of record, your Honour, as is apparent from Trial Chamber \\n\\nV(A)\\'s decision to terminate the Ruto and Sang trial without prejudice, quote, \"due to \\n\\na troubling incidence of witness interference and intolerable political meddling that \\n\\nwas reasonably likely to intimidate witnesses\".    Unquote.     \\n\\nThe Defence\\'s attempts to whitewash the phenomenon of witness interference as \\n\\nan invention of the unscrupulous witnesses to get witness protection -- to get into \\n\\nwitness protection simply cannot stand in the face of overwhelming evidence to the \\n\\ncontrary.     \\n\\nFinally, and most implausibly, your Honour, the conspiracy must also have involved \\n\\nvarious intermediaries -- the various intermediaries whose attempts to corruptly \\n\\ninfluence the witnesses were captured verbatim in the OPC recordings.    This is the \\n\\nonly explanation that the Defence has for these recordings.    But for this to be true, \\n\\nthe intermediaries must have knowingly agreed to being recorded offering bribes to \\n\\nwitnesses, actions which would clearly be illegal in Kenya as they are before this \\n\\nCourt.    And having done so, Barasa and P-495 then travelled to neighbouring \\n\\ncountries, placing themselves at risk of arrest to meet with P-800 and P-613 \\n\\nrespectively.    Why then would they agree to cooperate?    What was in it for them?   \\n\\nIn the case of Yebei, Bett and Barasa, only an arrest warrant. \\n\\nTurning to the criticisms of the Prosecution\\'s investigation.    The Defence attempts to \\n\\nshift the Chamber\\'s focus from the evidence -- from the evidence to perceived \\n\\nshortcomings in the Prosecution\\'s investigation.    The Prosecution called P-730 to \\n\\nexplain why certain investigative avenues were pursued and why others could not be \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 23   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 24/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\ndue to the significant cooperation and security obstacles to operating in Kenya, \\n\\nparticularly in the Rift Valley.    The Defence had the opportunity to cross-examine \\n\\nhim, but his evidence stands undisturbed.    Nor did the Defence lead any evidence to \\n\\nthe contrary.     \\n\\nHowever, your Honour, these criticisms merely deflect from the cogent and \\n\\nconsistent evidence the Prosecution did collect and present to the Chamber. \\n\\nThe Prosecution -- the Defence complains that the witness -- the Prosecution did not \\n\\nvisit the crime scenes, which it perceives to be the Rift Valley.    However, your \\n\\nHonour, many of these crimes took place not only in the Rift Valley, but at many \\n\\nlocations across the region.    So for instance, investigators were present observing \\n\\nBarasa corruptly influencing one witness, and P-495 corruptly influencing another.     \\n\\nYour Honour, I will skip a little bit of that because it\\'s of less importance. \\n\\nThe Defence criticises the Prosecution for failing to call or interview certain witnesses.   \\n\\nThe Defence complains, amongst others, that the Prosecution failed to call each \\n\\ninvestigator so that they could be confronted by the Defence, and that the OTP did \\n\\nnot interview each and every one of the managers and intermediaries of the common \\n\\nplan.     \\n\\nHowever, the Prosecution is not required to interview every alleged conspirator or to \\n\\ncall every person involved in the investigation just so that the Defence can \\n\\ncross-examine them.    While an accused has the right to confront all witnesses against \\n\\nhim or her, this does not extend to a right to insist that the Prosecution calls a certain \\n\\nwitness just so they might be confronted.     \\n\\nI also note that the Defence has had the Prosecution\\'s witness list since November \\n\\n2021, and if they considered that the accused\\'s fair trial rights were breached by the \\n\\nfailure to call certain witnesses, this should have been raised at the appropriate time \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 24   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 25/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nso that the Chamber could rule upon it.    The Defence of course has the right to \\n\\ninvestigate their theories themselves and to call their own witnesses, including \\n\\nProsecution witnesses, if necessary.    They can also ask the Chamber to call witnesses \\n\\nunder Article 64(6)(d).    Having elected not to do so, the Defence cannot now \\n\\ncomplain that their evidence is not before the Chamber or speculate as to what it \\n\\nmight have revealed. \\n\\nThe Defence criticises the Prosecution\\'s witness interviews and preparation sessions, \\n\\nhinting at prosecutorial conduct while establishing none.    These criticisms are \\n\\nunfounded and, in any event, irrelevant to the assessment of evidence.     \\n\\nAs regards the witness preparation sessions, the Defence complains of improper \\n\\ncoaching by the Prosecution.    But witness preparation was conducted strictly \\n\\naccording to the relevant protocol.    Should the Defence have had grounds to doubt \\n\\nthis, then they should have followed the remedies provided in the protocol at the \\n\\nrelevant time.    These include requesting copies of the video recordings of such \\n\\nsessions if there were grounds to suspect any misconduct.     \\n\\nThe Prosecution observes that, in fact, on two occasions the Defence did request such \\n\\nrecordings, both of which were granted by the Chamber.    Significantly, however, the \\n\\nDefence failed to identify any improper conduct that was revealed in these recorded \\n\\nsessions.    Yet they now speculate about impermissible coaching by the Prosecution \\n\\nin other witness preparation sessions for which they did not even request the \\n\\nrecordings.     \\n\\nThe Defence also complains about the duration of certain witness preparation \\n\\nsessions, but misrepresents the facts.    So, for instance, the Defence claims that the \\n\\nProsecution \"proofed\", quote-unquote, P-516, quote, \"for seven days for a period of 43 \\n\\nhours and 15 minutes, during which 48 documents were shown to him.\"    Unquote.   \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 25   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 26/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nWhile the total number of hours is correct, the Defence omits to mention that the vast \\n\\nmajority of the time was spent by the witness reading his prior statements and \\n\\ntestimony in both the Ruto and Sang and case and the present matter, as the Witness \\n\\nPreparation Protocol requires.    The protocol specifies that, quote: \\n\\n\"during the preparation sessions, the questioning lawyer must: [...] Provide the \\n\\nwitness with an opportunity to review his or her prior statements\".

Rather, their complaint \\n\\nappears to concern the protocol itself, notwithstanding that they did not object to this \\n\\nat the time. \\n\\nI will move on, your Honour, to the final topic, which is the Defence\\'s submissions on \\n\\nthe modes of liability. \\n\\nThe Defence criticises the Prosecution\\'s submissions on the mode of liability with \\n\\nrespect to the actions of certain associates, but this criticism is misconceived and \\n\\nbased on a misrepresentation -- a misapprehension of the Court\\'s jurisprudence.    I \\n\\nrefer to paragraphs 167 to 186 of the Defence brief.    The Defence claims that the \\n\\nProsecution, quote, \"misleads the Trial Chamber into overreaching and exceeding the \\n\\nscope of the charges\".    Unquote.    Not so. \\n\\nThe Prosecution\\'s primary position is that the associates are co-perpetrators - the \\n\\nrelevant associates being discussed - and that their contributions were essential even \\n\\nif, with the exception of P-800, they intervened only with respect to one incident.    As \\n\\nthe Appeals Chamber has confirmed, a co-perpetrator need not, quote, \"make an \\n\\nintentional contribution to each of the specific crimes [...] that were committed on the \\n\\nbasis of the common plan\", unquote, provided that those criminal incidents occur, \\n\\nquote, \"within the framework of a criminal common plan, to which the co-perpetrator \\n\\nmade an essential [element] with intent and knowledge\".    Unquote.     \\n\\nIn this case, the Prosecution submits that the Pre-Trial Chamber erred in finding that, \\n\\nbecause the associates - except P-800 - each intervened only once to contact and \\n\\npersuade one witness to meet Gicheru or to withdraw as Prosecution witnesses, they \\n\\ndid not make an essential contribution to the furtherance of the common plan.    But \\n\\nthe Trial Chamber is not bound by the PTC\\'s application of the law of co-perpetration \\n\\nto the facts, and may draw its own conclusions based on the facts and circumstances \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 27   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 28/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nas confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:38:42] Mr Steynberg, your time is up.    I will give \\n\\nyou some two minutes more to conclude, please. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [10:38:51] Thank you, your Honour, I will wrap it up in two \\n\\nminutes.     \\n\\nJust to round off this point then, your Honour, while the Chamber is barred under \\n\\nArticle 74(2) of the Statute from exceeding the facts and circumstances described in \\n\\nthe charges, it may nonetheless, quote, \"evaluate them differently\", unquote.    I refer \\n\\nto the Al Hassan Charges Procedure Decision, at paragraphs 46 to 47.    And in \\n\\nOngwen, the Pre-Trial Chamber held that, quote: \\n\\n\"[if] the Defence\" -- that \"the Defence can raise at trial the matter of the proper \\n\\ninterpretation of article 25(3)(c) of the Statute as the Trial Chamber is not legally \\n\\nbound to follow the Chamber\\'s interpretation [of] the Confirmation Decision\" -- \"in \\n\\nthe Confirmation Decision\".    I beg your pardon.     \\n\\nHence, the associates\\' actions were confirmed by the PTC, and fall within the \\n\\nparameters of the charges, and the Chamber may conclude that they are in fact \\n\\nco-perpetrators and that their actions may be attributed to the accused.     \\n\\nI will leave that there. \\n\\nFinally, your Honour, I point out as a housekeeping matter, one or two incorrect \\n\\ncross-references in the footnotes, but I don\\'t think I\\'ll need to read that out since I \\n\\nhave handed up my reading notes and, if necessary, the Prosecution can file \\n\\na corrigendum of the closing brief.     \\n\\nThank you, your Honour.

You have them before you, you be the judge of it, no \\n\\npun intended. \\n\\nThe OTP in its closing brief brazenly entreat you to inappropriately draw negative \\n\\ninferences against Mr Gicheru and to unjustifiably relieve it of its burden of proof.   \\n\\nHaving relied almost exclusively on the testimony of grifters, opportunists, skilled \\n\\nstorytellers and documented liars, and with the Defence having exposed the \\n\\nabundance of reasonable doubt on every count in the case, the OTP now is faced with \\n\\nan acute dilemma:    How to dress up its witnesses, how to rehabilitate them, how to \\n\\ntransform them into honest, truthful, disinterested witnesses.    How to manipulate \\n\\ntheir testimony.    How to overlook their major - not minor, as they \\n\\ncharacterise - inconsistencies and overall flaws.    How to ignore their discredited \\n\\ntestimony.    Or shall I put it, how to make a silk purse from a sow\\'s ear.     \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 29   \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 30/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nMotivated by raw, unconstrained desire to win and corrupted by tunnel vision, \\n\\nevident from the way the investigation was conducted - and here, we never \\n\\ncomplained about not bringing those witnesses, but why didn\\'t they investigate those \\n\\nthey claim are part of this grand scheme - the OTP bought into and latched on to lies, \\n\\nfairy tales, fantastical excuses and rationalisations, all while ignoring obvious flaws \\n\\nand contradictions, and weaponising, weaponising the verb \"to clarify\" into a means \\n\\nof confabulation and memory development. \\n\\nIf you didn\\'t get the facts right the first time or the second time, if you didn\\'t tell us \\n\\ntruth, just try, try, try again and again and again.    We\\'ll just call them minor \\n\\ninconsistencies, and your countless attempts to get it right, as we heard, clarifications.   \\n\\nJust keep clarifying.     \\n\\nRealising that it cannot withstand the scrutiny demanded by the statutory provisions \\n\\nof the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the ICC, the OTP now advocates for you, \\n\\nMadam President, to put your thumbs -- your thumb on the scales of justice to tilt \\n\\nthem in favour by overlooking the weaknesses and gaps in its case, by casually \\n\\nassessing the evidence, by accepting its testimony on whose voice it is on the \\n\\ntape-recorded conversation and to adopt its interpretation of what was said in \\n\\nanother telephone conversation by one of its witnesses who was scripted by the OTP \\n\\ninvestigators, but unfortunately, was unavailable to be confronted, examined and \\n\\nimpeached by the Defence. \\n\\nThe OTP, in its brief, argues that it was disadvantaged, and that we took advantage of \\n\\nthem by tailoring our case to its evidence by stonewalling them.    Not agreeing to its \\n\\nproposed agreed facts; not divulging the theory of the Defence; not giving an opening \\n\\nstatement; and not putting our case to the witnesses.    They argue that you should \\n\\nview the evidence through its result-determinative prism; that you assess the \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 30   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 31/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nevidence by ignoring critical nuances in the ICC jurisprudence, which I\\'ll point out; \\n\\nthat you overlook the lack of quality in its investigation.    Yes, they are expected to go \\n\\nand investigate. \\n\\nThat you fill in and bridge over the gaping gaps in their case; that you excuse the lack \\n\\nof certainty and ignore the reasonable doubt that persists in this case, and, might I \\n\\nadd, that you haphazardly find that it has met its burden of proof.     \\n\\nNow, let me talk a little bit about this notion that we tailored the defence.    They \\n\\nargue that we tailored our defence by stonewalling.    I\\'ve never seen this before in \\n\\na brief, I must confess.    This is paragraph 63 and 309 of their brief.    This argument is \\n\\nembarrassingly amateurish, and it\\'s -- as it is, how shall I put it, absurdly vacuous.     \\n\\nFirstly, it is undisputably obvious that we, the Defence, relied exclusively on the \\n\\ndisclosed material that we got from the OTP.    There were no tricks.    There were no \\n\\nsurprises.    There was no new evidence.    Just what was in their possession for years \\n\\nand years, except the newly evidence that they came up with that was disclosed to us \\n\\nthrough this clarifying and memory-development interviews and proofing sessions, \\n\\nwhich we discussed during the trial. \\n\\nSecondly, about tailoring.    Here, with apologies, I might have to give a short lecture \\n\\nto the Prosecution on the art of trial advocacy.    A trial by its very nature is an organic \\n\\nprocess.    It\\'s dynamic.    It\\'s not static.    And it\\'s a cardinal rule that you show up \\n\\nprepared, but you remain flexible.    You remain in the moment.    And to do \\n\\notherwise, to do otherwise could amount to ineffective assistance of counsel.     \\n\\nWhen circumstances change, you should adapt.    But once a theory is chosen, the trial \\n\\nbegins with that theory, strategies and tactics may alter, but the theory remains.   \\n\\nAnd we\\'ll talk about our theory, too.     \\n\\nThirdly, where in the statutory provisions -- where in the statutory provisions, the \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 31   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 32/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nrules, the regulations, the practice directives or jurisprudence, does it prohibit the \\n\\nDefence from recalibrating or tailoring its defence during the proceedings?    I\\'ve \\n\\nsearched.    I haven\\'t been able to find any authority.    I\\'m unaware of any authority.   \\n\\nThis is the very first I\\'ve ever heard of this.     \\n\\nFinally, so what.    So what.    How did this supposed tailoring we engaged in \\n\\ncompromise the OTP in presenting its case or negatively impact its burden of proof \\n\\nobligation?    How?   \\n\\nRather than own up to the inconvenient details of its evidence and to make a go at \\n\\narguing at the evidence, and to show that they proved their case beyond a reasonable \\n\\ndoubt, they opt for excuses, and they opt for what I call the skunk factor.     \\n\\nYou bring a skunk into the courtroom for a second or two, take him out.    The skunk \\n\\nis out, but the stench remains.    It\\'s all about insinuation.     \\n\\nSimply, the Prosecution is attempting to deflect and misdirect, to patch and gloss over \\n\\nits inadequacies and failures to influence you by insinuating you to draw negative \\n\\ninferences.    In other words, to compensate and assist it meeting its burden of proof. \\n\\nThey say we did not agree to their proposed agreed facts.    Where in the Statute, in \\n\\nthe rules, or the jurisprudence says that the Defence must agree to their proposed \\n\\nagreed facts?     \\n\\nAnd so what, again.    How did this unwillingness or inability on our behalf \\n\\ncompromise the OTP in presenting its case or negatively impacting its burden of \\n\\nproof obligation?     \\n\\nThey argue we did not disclose in advance the basis of our defence.    My goodness.   \\n\\nI\\'m hearing this from professional prosecutors at an international tribunal.    Where, \\n\\nin the Statute, the Rules of jurisprudence, does it say that the Defence must explain its \\n\\ncase to the OTP in advance?    Where?     \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 32   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 33/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nBut it gets better.    But in any event, should I have telegraphed or emailed or sent him \\n\\na WhatsApp message to tell them, \"Hey, here are the weaknesses in your case.   \\n\\nPlease sure them up by doing a little clarifying and memory development when you \\n\\nquestion the witnesses and you proof them.\"     \\n\\nCan the OTP seriously, truthfully claim that they were in the dark?    When you \\n\\nconsider our submissions to the Document Containing the Charges, our numerous \\n\\nrequests for disclosure material, the general nature of the statements of the witnesses \\n\\nthat they chose to bring to this Court, can they seriously say?    A newly minted \\n\\nlawyer with, I submit, a basic trial advocacy course of a few days under his or her belt \\n\\ncould figure out the defence.     \\n\\nBut it gets better.    I submit that the Prosecution, especially the senior trial lawyer in \\n\\nthis case, is being economical with the truth when he claims that we did not explain \\n\\nour theory of the case.     \\n\\nYou may recall during the cross-examination of P-0613, in response to an intervention, \\n\\nI laid out the theory, the thesis, as I called it at the time.    And later on - and this in \\n\\nthe transcript 058, page 14 - the Prosecutor, Mr Steynberg, stands up and says, quote:   \\n\\n\"I am always grateful when we actually have some notice as to what the Defence \\n\\ntheory is.\"     \\n\\nNow, granted, it was only the second witness.    So we had been in the case for \\n\\na matter of two or three days, but can he seriously say that we didn\\'t know -- that we \\n\\ndidn\\'t disclose our theory?     \\n\\nBut, again, so what.    So what if we did not indulge them by providing them in \\n\\nadvance what the theory was.    Although I say that even Stevie Wonder, the great \\n\\nAmerican blind, you know, singer, could see what the defence was.    How did this \\n\\nfailure on our part compromise the OTP in presenting its case or negatively impact its \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 33   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 34/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nburden of proof?     \\n\\nThey go on and they complain, we did not give an opening statement.    Goodness \\n\\ngracious.    We did not give an opening statement.    Where in the Statute does it say \\n\\nthat the Defence must give an opening statement?    It doesn\\'t.    And not to mention \\n\\nan opening statement is not evidence.     \\n\\nAnd so what?    How did this strategic or tactical decision on the part of the Defence \\n\\ncompromise the OTP in presenting its case or negatively impact its burden of proof \\n\\nobligation?     \\n\\nFrankly, if I were a prosecutor, or in this case, the Deputy Prosecutor of the ICC, I \\n\\nwould be embarrassed to argue this, no less put it in writing for God and mankind to \\n\\nsee it in perpetuity, that the Prosecution was disadvantaged, or that the Defence \\n\\ngained an advantage by not giving an opening statement.     \\n\\nThey claim we did not put on a case in detail to -- we did not put our case in detail to \\n\\neach of the OTP witnesses.    There\\'s no statutory provision or rule in the ICC \\n\\nrequiring the Defence to put its case in detail to each witness.     \\n\\nNow, there is a provision in the ICTY.    And in the Ruto and Sang case, there was \\n\\na practice directive that suggested that it would be a good idea to put your case to the \\n\\nwitness so that the witness would not be confused.    But there\\'s no obligation.     \\n\\nInterestingly, they cite the very famous Browne v. Dunn case.    It\\'s an Australian case, \\n\\nas I understand it.    In the United States, we don\\'t have this notion of putting the case \\n\\nto the witness, you know, nor do we even use the phrase \"I put to you\".    Though I \\n\\nused it because we are in this international setting and this seems to be the norm.     \\n\\nBut in citing Browne v.

Anyone watching \\n\\nand listening to the cross-examination of the witnesses could tell, would have noticed \\n\\nthat Ms Tomanovic and I robustly put our case to the witness.     \\n\\nBut even if we failed to do that - as they claim - so what. \\n\\nHow did this failure compromise the OTP in presenting its case or negatively impact \\n\\nits burden of proof obligation?     \\n\\nWe submit that the OTP is misdirecting you to view the evidence through a distorted, \\n\\nresult-determinative prism.    The OTP argues that you not assess the evidence of each \\n\\nwitness separately -- at least, that\\'s our reading of their brief.    We disagree.    The \\n\\nICC jurisprudence from Bemba et al. informs us of a more nuanced approach than \\n\\nthat which is claimed by the Prosecutor.     \\n\\nThe Bemba et al. Trial Chamber held that, quote: \\n\\n\"[...] each statement made by a witness must be assessed individually.\"     \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 35   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 36/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nEach statement made by a witness must be assessed individually.   \\n\\nNow this is the Trial Chamber, mind you, and it\\'s in paragraph 202, but finding no \\n\\nerror of this approach, the Appeals Chamber noted in paragraphs 1019, this is Bemba \\n\\net al.: \\n\\n\"[...] whether a particular witness is considered credible will depend on a case-by-case \\n\\nassessment of the evidence, in light of all relevant circumstances.\" \\n\\nGiven the nature, we submit, of the testimony of the witnesses, the extent of their \\n\\nimpeachment, their numerous statements, their clarifications, their half-truths, their \\n\\nlies, their inconsistencies, the uncorroborated hearsay, we submit that, with respect, \\n\\nthat you must assess each statement made by the witnesses individually.     \\n\\nThe OTP argues that you holistically analyse each individual item of evidence in light \\n\\nof the entire body of evidence, even if, when viewed in isolation, they are open to \\n\\ndifferent interpretations; that\\'s paragraph 11 and 13 of their brief.     \\n\\nWe disagree.    This approach to analysing the evidence holistically, as they claim it, is \\n\\nnot consistent with ICC jurisprudence, nor is it a sound approach in this particular \\n\\ncase in light of the testimony of the witnesses.     \\n\\nThe Appeals Chamber in Gbagbo and in the separate opinion of Judges Van den \\n\\nWyngaert and Morrison in the Bemba appeal judgment are instructive, and, we \\n\\nsubmit, should give sufficient guidance to you in assessing the evidence.     \\n\\nBut what does a holistic evaluation of the evidence mean?     \\n\\nWell, it means that the weight accorded to individual witnesses evidence \\n\\nshould -- should be determined in conjunction with other relevant evidence; Gbagbo, \\n\\nappeal judgment, paragraph 67, and that separate opinion I noted in paragraph 15, in \\n\\nthe Bemba et al.     \\n\\nSo in holistically evaluating the witness\\'s testimony, what must be considered?

But here, I would add one more.    I would add the days and the hours \\n\\nspent during the so-called proofing sessions.     \\n\\nNow Judge Van den Wyngaert and Morrison further explain in paragraph 15 of their \\n\\nseparate opinion in Bemba, that holistic fact-finding cannot and, I quote, can: \\n\\n\"[...] not be an excuse or a reason for making findings beyond a reasonable doubt on \\n\\nthe basis of a collection of weak evidence.\"     \\n\\nAnd, they go on to say, it: \\n\\n\"[...] cannot cure the weaknesses of individual items of evidence [...]\" \\n\\nIt cannot be an excuse or a reason for making findings beyond a reasonable doubt on \\n\\nthe basis of a collection of weak evidence, which we submit you have before you, and \\n\\nit cannot cure the weaknesses of individual items of evidence. \\n\\nThe OTP argues that you may rely on one part of a witness\\'s testimony while rejecting \\n\\nothers, since no witness is per se    unreliable.    Well, you know, even the clock is \\n\\nright twice -- a broken clock is correct twice a day.    Fair enough.     \\n\\nNo witness is per se, unreliable, but then again, the jurisprudence of the ICC is \\n\\nsomewhat more nuanced.    In Ngudjolo - I apologise for my pronunciation of the \\n\\nnames - informs us that, and this is in the appeal judgment, paragraph 168, that some \\n\\nwitnesses may be impeached to such a degree that they, quote: \\n\\n\"[...] cannot be relied upon even if other evidence appears to corroborate parts of his \\n\\nor her testimony.\" \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 37   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 38/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nThey go on to say: \\n\\n\"[...] witnesses whose credibility is [impeached]\", quote, \"may be relied upon to the \\n\\nextent that [they are] corroborated by other reliable evidence.\" \\n\\nThis is the jurisprudence, and all we ask is that you follow it. \\n\\nThe OTP argues that you need not consider evidence tainted or unreliable due to \\n\\nwhat they call minor inconsistencies; that\\'s in paragraph 28.    Well, if they were \\n\\nminor inconsistencies, I can assure you, your Honour, we certainly didn\\'t waste our \\n\\ntime during our cross-examination of those witnesses.    We went after the big ticket \\n\\nitems. \\n\\nWith the exception of two of their witnesses, all the other witnesses who appeared in \\n\\ncourt were impeached to such an extent and their evidence was shown to be so full of \\n\\nmajor inconsistencies on core aspects of their testimony, that they are, we submit, \\n\\nincapable of belief.    They lied.    They lied under oath.    They lied under oath with \\n\\ndetermined reason and purpose.     \\n\\nAnd here, let me just go off script and say I\\'m offended by my colleague\\'s -- my \\n\\nlearned colleague\\'s suggestion that I somehow was suggesting that all Africans want \\n\\nto leave for Europe.    That was not the claim.    The witnesses that he paraded before \\n\\nyou, those were the ones that we demonstrated had a plan and wanted to get out, and \\n\\nwe demonstrated that. \\n\\nAnd we, in fact, brought one witness -- they brought one witness who gave good \\n\\nevidence on how he and two other witnesses plotted how to lie to the Prosecution, \\n\\nknowing that the investigators were not going into the field, and to that they say, so \\n\\nwhat.    We say so plenty. \\n\\nThe OTP claims the Chamber should distinguish the actions and statements made \\n\\nwhile the witnesses were under the corrupt influence of the perpetrators and the \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 38   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 39/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nstatements when the influence was removed.    And this is in paragraph 35.     \\n\\nWell, first of all, they provide no legal authority as to that\\'s how you should posit the \\n\\nassessment process.    Well, how do you determine when they were under influence?   \\n\\nAt what point?    And when, supposedly, this influence was lifted without doing \\n\\na complete evaluation of the witnesses\\' testimony, without analysing that in \\n\\nconjunction with everything else, as I\\'ll talk about it in a bit.   \\n\\nThe OTP is asking you, your Honour, to ignore weaknesses, inadequacies, \\n\\ncontradictions, documented lies and uncorroborated hearsay to support their position.   \\n\\nAnd they\\'re asking you to essentially cherry-pick, to simply adopt the most recent one, \\n\\nthe most recent version of the many, many events.    We had one witness, you know, \\n\\nhe was questioned 50-sum times.    Just adopt the very, very last one because, by that \\n\\npoint, the clarification and memory development had been solidly put in place. \\n\\nNormally, I wouldn\\'t do this but -- in an international court, but I think it would be \\n\\ninstructive considering the nature of the evidence that we heard and the arguments \\n\\nthat are being made by the Prosecution, I\\'m going to give an example. \\n\\nI used to tell this to my juries, but I think it\\'s apt for judges as well, and it\\'s my beef \\n\\nstew example.     \\n\\nSuppose you go to a restaurant and you order a beef stew.    That\\'s your favourite \\n\\nmeal.    You\\'ve been looking forward to it.    Maybe you\\'ve been to that restaurant \\n\\nbefore.    That beef stew looks good.    Right texture, right colour.    The scent, \\n\\nunbelievable.    Take a spoon full, my goodness, it\\'s tasty.    Take a second one.    Then \\n\\nyou bite into a piece of meat.    The first piece is good.    The second one is also good.   \\n\\nTender, moist.    The third one, you realise is rotten.    It\\'s bad. \\n\\nNow what are you to do?    Are you supposed to sift through your beef stew to figure \\n\\nout which piece of meat is good, if any of them now, because all of them have been \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 39   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 40/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\ncontaminated by the bad meat or should you say, \"You know what, I\\'m going to put \\n\\nthis dish aside, maybe I\\'ll order something different -- or better yet, I\\'ll go to another \\n\\nrestaurant.\"     \\n\\nThat\\'s what they\\'re asking you to do, your Honour.    They\\'re asking you to sift \\n\\nthrough and try to cherry-pick and decide what pieces of evidence a witness gave \\n\\nmight be -- after being impeached or all over the place, might be good enough for you \\n\\nto latch on in order to find reasonable -- that they proved their case beyond a \\n\\nreasonable doubt.    We submit that the witnesses were so corrupted in their own \\n\\ncontradictions, that you cannot easily find what is good and what is bad.    Like that \\n\\nbeef stew.    Better set it aside. \\n\\nThe OTP is misleading you into misapplying ICC jurisprudence on corroboration.   \\n\\nNormally, I wouldn\\'t lecture -- you know, I wouldn\\'t dare lecture a court on what the \\n\\nlaw is, but -- and nor am I trying to lecture, but merely offer some -- my perspective \\n\\non what I believe or we believe the law is on corroboration before the ICC -- based on \\n\\nthe ICC jurisprudence.     \\n\\nAnd, of course, the Prosecution made a big deal about this -- about corroboration, \\n\\ncorroboration.    And they argue that corroboration is not required; that it is merely on \\n\\noccasional important factor.    That\\'s paragraph 32 of their brief.     \\n\\nNot required.    Just an occasional -- an occasional important factor.     \\n\\nWell, in this case, I submit corroboration on all those witnesses was indeed an \\n\\nimportant factor, not on occasional one.    And they are economical again with the \\n\\ninterpretation of settled ICC jurisprudence.    Here, I would submit we look at the \\n\\nAppeals Chamber in Bemba et al. paragraphs 1084; Gbagbo, appeals judgment, \\n\\nparagraph 357, they inform that corroboration may be required -- may be required to \\n\\nbe convinced of the credibility of a witness and reliability of the witnesses\\' testimony.     \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 40   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 41/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nThe Appeals Chamber in Ngudjolo, paragraph 168, as well as in Bemba et al., trial \\n\\njudgment 204, further informs that where a Trial Chamber has reservations about the \\n\\ncredibility of a witness -- has reservations about the credibility of a witness, it may \\n\\nrely on his or her evidence, quote:     \\n\\n\"[...] to the extent that it is corroborated by other reliable -- other reliable evidence [...]\", \\n\\nnoting that some witnesses may be, quote, impugned, may be impugned to such \\n\\na degree that they cannot be relied upon even - even, I underscore that - if other \\n\\nevidence appears to corroborate. \\n\\nCiting -- they cite an ICTR -- they cite ICTR case law.    They argue that by -- in citing \\n\\nthat, that witnesses corroborate each other when, quote: \\n\\n\"[o]ne prima facie credible testimony is compatible with another prima facie credible \\n\\ntestimony regarding the same fact or a sequence of facts [...]\"     \\n\\nParagraph 33, footnote 64.    So that\\'s what they say.   \\n\\nNow surprisingly I went and looked at that, this fine Defence team, surprisingly, the \\n\\nOTP cites authority that has been rejected by the ICC Appeals Chamber.    Now I\\'m \\n\\ngoing to give them the benefit of the doubt.    I certainly don\\'t think that they\\'re trying \\n\\nto deliberately misrepresent -- to take an advantage, but merely it\\'s just sort of the \\n\\nendemic sloppiness that we\\'ve seen throughout the trial in their failure of diligence at \\n\\ntimes.    The Gbagbo Appeals Chamber summarily rejected the string of ICTY \\n\\ncase law cited by the Prosecution for the very same proposition, finding that, quote:   \\n\\n\"[...] there is need -- there is need for great care in describing the parameters of \\n\\ncorroboration in terms so broad and uncertain.\"   \\n\\nParagraph 358 of the Gbagbo appeal judgment.   \\n\\nThey go on to say that they did not consider that the ICTR\\'s description of \\n\\ncorroboration, quote: \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 41   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 42/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n\"[...] means, without more, that two pieces of evidence corroborate each other merely \\n\\nby bearing a relationship to the same fact.\"     \\n\\nA relationship -- so when we talk about compatibility, that\\'s what they\\'re talking \\n\\nabout.    Paragraph 358 of that particular appeal judgment, that may be of use. \\n\\nThey argue that witness corroboration -- that witnesses corroborate each other \\n\\nbecause their testimony is, quote/unquote, thematically consistent.    It\\'s thematically \\n\\nconsistent.    They have a theme.    I\\'m going to talk about that in a bit as well.    But \\n\\nthis is an absurdity, we submit.     \\n\\nThey -- first of all, they submit -- they cite no legal authority.    Zero.    Where does it \\n\\nsay in the jurisprudence -- well, in their brief, they don\\'t cite anything.    Where \\n\\nthematically consistent is good enough, that means corroboration.     \\n\\nJudge Henderson who prior to coming to the ICC was -- had a distinguished career, a \\n\\nvery distinguished career as a career prosecutor.    So he wasn\\'t one of these liberal \\n\\ndefence lawyers.    You know, he\\'s a career prosecutor.    In the Gbagbo trial judgment, \\n\\nit explained why the hearsay statements made by unreliable witnesses \\n\\ncannot -- cannot mutually corroborate each other.    And here\\'s what he says.    Now, \\n\\nthis is a former career prosecutor, now judge:   \\n\\n\"Corroboration only occurs when two pieces of evidence independently confirm the \\n\\nsame fact\", quote/unquote.   \\n\\nAnd he goes on, quote: \\n\\n\"[...] requires the respective items of evidence to have some intrinsic probative value \\n\\nin their own right.\"    End of quote.     \\n\\nAnd he illustrates, quote: \\n\\n\"[...] if two items of evidence -- if two items of evidence assert the same fact based on \\n\\nanonymous hearsay, the combined evidentiary weight remains negligible, even if \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 42   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 43/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nthere are grounds -- even if there are grounds to believe that the respective \\n\\nanonymous sources are independent of each other.\"    And you can find that in the \\n\\ntrial judgment of his reasons, paragraphs 47 and 49. \\n\\nIn rejecting the ICTR case law on corroboration cited by the OTP, the Gbagbo appeals \\n\\njudgment -- the Appeals Chamber, paragraph 358, also said -- considered that mere \\n\\nconsistencies or compatibilities in a witness\\'s testimonies are not sufficient for \\n\\ncorroboration explaining, quote: \\n\\n\"The mere fact that items of evidence may have a linkage does not\" - I repeat - \"does \\n\\nnot mean that they are corroborative of one another [...]\"   \\n\\nThis is ICC jurisprudence.     \\n\\nSo corroboration is not just merely a factor that you occasionally look at, especially \\n\\nwhen you\\'ve got witnesses that have been extensively impeached, and we submit that \\n\\nthe case law that we provide is -- provides ample guidance to you, your Honour. \\n\\nNow the OTP is misdirecting you to speculate -- I\\'m not going to go into too much of \\n\\nthis, but just hit some highlights and I will try to go rather quickly.    Whether the \\n\\nDefence question all the witnesses, because they make a big deal of it, one witness \\n\\nwas not questioned.    Ah, therefore, what that witness said, that\\'s proof beyond a \\n\\nreasonable doubt.    No.    I\\'m sorry.    That\\'s not how it works. \\n\\nWhether we question a witness or not is irrelevant.    And it\\'s irrelevant because they \\n\\nhave the burden of proof.    We decide whether we are going to question somebody or \\n\\nnot.     \\n\\nNow, on that particular witness, which we didn\\'t question, what could that witness \\n\\nhave offered?    Never met Mr Gicheru.    Never knew Mr Gicheru.    Never heard \\n\\nMr Gicheru.    But the Prosecutor speculates -- testifies essentially, Ah, it was \\n\\nMr Gicheru on the line.

We\\'re not saying that these experts were \\n\\nnot experts, but what does that data tell us?    It doesn\\'t tell us anything.    The \\n\\nProsecutor today testified a little bit telling us what inferences you should draw.   \\n\\nWell, that\\'s not in the reports.    They can\\'t tell us when those numbers were actually \\n\\nin at the time. \\n\\nWhether the Defence dispute the authenticity or reliability of the bank records is \\n\\nirrelevant.    You can bring all sorts of bank statements.    That doesn\\'t solve the issue, \\n\\nwhere did that money come from? \\n\\nWe provided some alternative plausible explanations, there may be more.    He says, \\n\\n\"Well, 25 dependents, that\\'s how it normally works.\"    Well, what he omits to say is \\n\\nthat that gentleman wanted him and his 25 dependents to be taken to Canada.   \\n\\nThat\\'s what that was all about.     \\n\\nAs for the other gentleman, we know that when he left his house, as it was being \\n\\nburnt, the one thing they took with them were the land titles.    Did the Prosecution \\n\\never investigate what he had to see whether any sales were made?    Did they \\n\\ninvestigate?    No. \\n\\nThey say, \"Well, the Defence should come in and investigate.\"      That\\'s not my job.   \\n\\nThat\\'s not my job.    My job is not to solve.    They don\\'t talk about that.    His job is to \\n\\nprove.    Whether the Defence disputed expert evidence on enhancement of audio \\n\\nrecordings, that\\'s irrelevant.    What\\'s relevant is the veracity of what is being said and \\n\\nthe ability to test that -- to test what is on that. \\n\\nWhether the Defence disprove what was said by witnesses in audio recordings -- the \\n\\nsame thing.    Whether the Defence disproved what was said by P-0397 in that \\n\\nscripted conversation, well, you have Mr Gicheru\\'s statement and he does give an \\n\\nexplanation.    Now, they make a big deal, and say, \"Well, you know, he denied \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 44   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 45/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nknowing them.\"    Well, if one person is missing and is well known and another one is \\n\\ndead, and that\\'s well known, someone being questioned as a suspect and being asked \\n\\nabout those two individuals, might be hesitant.     \\n\\nHere, again, I normally wouldn\\'t say this in front of an international judge, but I\\'ll use \\n\\none of my examples that I would in front of a jury.     \\n\\nMr Gicheru is only human.    Now St Peter denied Christ three times and he was told \\n\\nin advance, \"You\\'re going to deny me.\"    He said, \"No, no, no, don\\'t worry about me.   \\n\\nI\\'m solid.    I\\'m there.    I\\'m with you.\"    He denied Christ three times.     \\n\\nNow, that was St Peter.    Are we going to hold Mr Gicheru to a higher standard?    It\\'s \\n\\nnot possible that under stress, under fear of maybe being implicated in the \\n\\ndisappearance and murder of two individuals that the natural reaction would be, \"No, \\n\\nI don\\'t know these people.\"     \\n\\nBut then he did discuss his involvement.    As far as what was said on the \\n\\ntape-recorded conversation, there are a number of reasons why somebody might not \\n\\nanswer or might not interject, especially when it\\'s obvious from listening to the \\n\\nconversation that the one side of that conversation is trying to engage and trying to \\n\\ninject information into the conversation because that\\'s what was scripted for him.     \\n\\nBut your Honour, you have that evidence.    You don\\'t need a lecture from me on how \\n\\nto evaluate it. \\n\\nI\\'m almost there, I\\'m almost over -- good for my final remarks.     \\n\\nThe OTP argues - and I quote: \\n\\nWhere the Prosecution has produced evidence that establishes proof beyond \\n\\nreasonable doubt, unless the Defence is able to present controverting evidence \\n\\nsufficient to raise reasonable doubt, the Accused must be convicted.     \\n\\nThat\\'s in paragraph 18. \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 45   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 46/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nSo, they produce their evidence, unless we rebut it, you know.    Well, they either \\n\\nmisapprehend how evidence should be assessed or they simply attempt to mislead.   \\n\\nEither way, they\\'re wrong.    Whether the OTP has produced evidence establishing \\n\\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt is a question that can only be answered after -- and \\n\\nonly after all of the relevant evidence is assessed.    This includes the evidence \\n\\nadduced by the Defence. They claim we didn\\'t put on a defence, well, we did.    We \\n\\nput on a defence through cross-examination and everything that came in through \\n\\ncross-examination is evidence.    So it\\'s not, \"Well, we put the witness on direct, what \\n\\nthe witness said on direct is proof beyond a reasonable doubt.    If the Defence didn\\'t \\n\\ncontradict it, it stands.\"    It doesn\\'t work that way.     \\n\\nIt matters not whether the Defence opted to put on a defence by calling witnesses or \\n\\nnot.    Our witnesses -- our evidence came in through their cross-examination.    And \\n\\nwe submit that in assessing the evidence of each witness, you also have -- and \\n\\nwhether that evidence was presented to a level of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, it \\n\\nis necessary, almost, I would normally say it may be necessary, but in this case I \\n\\nwould say it is necessary for these particular witnesses to consider the assessed \\n\\nevidence of other witnesses and any other assessed relevant documentary evidence.     \\n\\nSo contrary -- contrary to the accusations lodged by my learned colleague that we \\n\\nsomehow want you to piecemeal it, no.    That\\'s not the case.    But you have to start \\n\\nsomewhere and you don\\'t start with a global picture.    You start by looking at each \\n\\nstatement individually, each witness individually.    Then you have -- you look at the \\n\\nother evidence and how each witness is    connected and all of them were \\n\\nconnected in one way or another, and we demonstrated that, and only through that \\n\\nprocess will you be able to find where the truth may lie -- or, better yet, or, I should \\n\\nsay, more importantly, whether the Prosecution has proved its case beyond a \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 46   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 47/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nreasonable doubt.     \\n\\nSo contrary to what my learned colleague is suggesting, and maybe I got it wrong, but \\n\\nthey seem to be suggesting that this is some sort of a competition between two \\n\\ncompeting narratives, and you are to decide which is the more attractive, persuasive, \\n\\ncompatible, thematically agreeable, or possible, or even plausible.     \\n\\nAnd I submit it is not.    It is not about selecting two competing narratives.    They \\n\\nhave a burden.    They have to prove their case.    I don\\'t have to put on a narrative, \\n\\nbut I can poke holes at their case.    I can show that they have reasonable doubt.    I \\n\\ncan show that the witnesses are inconsistent; that they have among themselves \\n\\nplanned and colluded.    And it\\'s not about weighing probabilities, which of the two \\n\\nversions is more, you know, probable.    It\\'s not about that.     \\n\\nIt\\'s not about beliefs, feelings, intuitions or suppositions.    It is not about opinions \\n\\nformed through the media, from having been exposed to information during the \\n\\nconfirmation process or even during the presentation of the evidence during the trial.   \\n\\nAnd let\\'s be honest, we\\'re all human.    We are influenced to one degree or another by \\n\\nwhat we hear and what we may be exposed of, and there\\'s nothing unusual or wrong \\n\\nwith that.    We\\'re going to form opinions, beliefs, hunches, but -- and this is the big \\n\\nbut, but when it comes to assessing the evidence at the end of the trial, these opinions, \\n\\nbeliefs, feelings, hunches and suppositions must be set aside.     \\n\\nNot only that, but we submit that you must guard vigilantly and uncompromisingly \\n\\nfrom assessing the evidence through a prism of those opinions, beliefs, suppositions.   \\n\\nAnd there lies the danger, we submit.    Far too often we form an opinion and then we \\n\\nbegin to look at the evidence and the facts, but we\\'re looking at it through the prism \\n\\nof that opinion that we\\'ve already formed, and that can misleading -- that can mislead \\n\\nus to the wrong assessment and we say that has to be set aside.     \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 47   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 48/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nSo what we\\'re asking you, your Honour, we\\'re asking you that you objectively assess \\n\\nthe evidence - as we know you will - without passion or prejudice, by strictly \\n\\nadhering to and remaining within the contours of the ICC jurisprudence.    And any \\n\\nopinions that might have been formed as a human being while the testimony was \\n\\nbeing heard, set that aside.    Look at the evidence objectively, all of it, holistically, as \\n\\nthe Prosecutor wants you to, but in the manner which we say it must be. \\n\\nNow let me conclude with a few words of the burden of proof beyond a \\n\\nreasonable -- and the burden beyond a reasonable doubt.     \\n\\nAgain normally, I wouldn\\'t do this in front of a judge, but I feel compelled that in this \\n\\ninstance this is one of those rare occasions in an international court, in front of \\n\\na professional judge that I might be of some use.    Especially, when you take up the \\n\\ntask which only you can do, this heavy burden of assessing all of the evidence and \\n\\ndetermining Mr Gicheru\\'s destiny. \\n\\nSo I think that the definition of proof beyond a reasonable doubt from my own \\n\\nnational jurisdiction, this is, Alaska, is a rather good one and it\\'s consistent with more \\n\\nor less the definitions used throughout the United States.    And it\\'s proof of such \\n\\na convincing nature, such a convincing nature that you are willing to rely and act \\n\\nupon it without hesitation in your most important affairs.    Rely and act on it without \\n\\nhesitation in your most important affairs.     \\n\\nNow, trying to explain that to a jury sometimes, it\\'s pretty difficult.    So the way I \\n\\nwould do it, is, maybe by way of example.    And in this particular case, I try to think \\n\\nwhat example might I give your Honour to sort of assist you as you and your staff are \\n\\nlooking at the evidence to have in the back of your mind as you assess the evidence.   \\n\\nWell, let\\'s just say, that this is not one of the most important affairs, buying a used car.   \\n\\nWhether you\\'re buying a new car or buying a house, or getting married, that\\'s an \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 48   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 49/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nimportant affair, but let\\'s just say just a used car.     \\n\\nNow, you\\'re like me, you don\\'t know too much about engines.    So you\\'re going to \\n\\nbring somebody along with you who knows a little bit, who\\'s going to be able to ask \\n\\nsome questions of the used car salesman because at least in the United States -- I don\\'t \\n\\nknow how it is anywhere else, but at least in the United States, used car salesmen are \\n\\nslick talkers, and half the time or most of the time they\\'re sort of embellishing the \\n\\nfacts.     \\n\\nSo you bring this fellow along to help you out buy this used car.    You see the car.    It \\n\\nlooks shiny.    It\\'s been washed, the wheels look good, the rims are shiny.    You pop \\n\\nup the hood or bonnet -- as the Brits say -- and you see this clean engine.    So -- and \\n\\nyou hear this gentleman say, \"Well, this is a new engine\", and he\\'s talking and talking \\n\\nand then, all of a sudden, your friend starts asking some questions.    And as he\\'s \\n\\nasking questions, he\\'s catching this car salesman in little lies, and then, more lies, and \\n\\nthen contradictions.    And after each contradiction or lie, there\\'s a clarification, \"Well, \\n\\nwhat I actually meant to say was this.\"    And this goes on for some while.     \\n\\nThe question is, you want a used car so you can take you and your family, your loved \\n\\nones, your friends, from point A to point B, go on the highway and be safe.    In that \\n\\ncircumstance -- in that circumstance, where the used car salesman is telling you all \\n\\nthese inconsistencies and lies and is unable to keep his story straight, would you, \\n\\nwithout hesitation, buy that car from that salesman? \\n\\nI dare say no.    But let\\'s just say, lo and behold as this is going on, somebody else \\n\\nshows up and he knows the used car salesman, maybe he\\'s also a used-car salesman, \\n\\nand he starts chiming in and echoing the same things that the first one is saying. \"Oh, \\n\\nyes, this is a new engine.\"   \\n\\nOf course your friend is pretty savvy.    So he starts asking questions of this fellow \\n\\n27.06.2022 \\n\\nPage 49   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cClosing Statements                                    (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-069-ENG ET WT 27-06-2022 50/52 NB T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nand, sure enough, the lies keep coming, the inconsistencies, the contradictions, and, \\n\\nall of a sudden, another one comes and the same thing goes on and on for about six to \\n\\neight witnesses, eight ones of these fellows.     \\n\\nWould you buy that used car?    Because now you\\'ve had eight people or five people, \\n\\nor six people or three people come and say, \"This is a new car, it\\'s got a new engine in \\n\\nthis used car. Believe what we\\'re telling you.\"     \\n\\nWould you be comfortable?    Would you without hesitation?    Would you be certain?   \\n\\nBecause that\\'s what proof beyond a reasonable doubt means, certainty.    Would you \\n\\nbe certain that this is the car that I must buy - without hesitation - and put my life and \\n\\nthe life of my loved ones in the hands of this particular car?    I dare so no.     \\n\\nAnd that\\'s how the Prosecution\\'s case is and we submit, your Honour, that in \\n\\nassessing the evidence, keep this in mind.    Because you should only find proof \\n\\nbeyond a reasonable doubt if you are certain.     \\n\\nWe submit that in this particular case, the OTP has failed to meet its burden of proof.   \\n\\nThe only appropriate, fair and just verdict is a not guilty verdict on all counts.     \\n\\nI notice I have a couple of minutes left, so I just want to thank everyone who made \\n\\nthis trial possible, starting with the stenographers and the interpreters, the IT folks, \\n\\nthe guards, the legal officers for the Registry, your legal officers and, of course, you.   \\n\\nWith all due candour, I can say that this is one of the best tried cases I\\'ve had in my \\n\\ncareer, and it\\'s a testament to everybody involved in this process, but especially you \\n\\nfor presiding over what I would call a very efficient, fair, balanced proceeding.     \\n\\nI want to thank the Prosecutor.

[9:36:47] Good morning, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:36:50] If you recall, last summer, in July 2021, you came to The Hague for \\n\\na period of four days to be interviewed by the Prosecution.    Do you recall that? \\n\\nA.      [9:37:15] Your Honour, it wasn\\'t July.     \\n\\nQ.      [09:37:21] It was July, right?    No, I\\'m -- I apologise -- my apologies.    It was in \\n\\nOctober. \\n\\nA.      [9:37:29] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:37:30] Right.    I stand corrected.

Would that be about right, during \\n\\nthe course of the four days? \\n\\nA.      [9:37:52] I don\\'t remember the exact time, but I know I had a meeting with them, \\n\\nyour Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:37:58] All right.    And we already discussed yesterday - and, we will discuss \\n\\nlater on today - one of the topics that was -- that you were questioned on and that had \\n\\nto do with conversations that you had with person number 12 back in 2014, when the \\n\\nProsecution had asked the Dutch government to monitor the mobile phone of person \\n\\nnumber -- number 12 and your voice was captured over a period of, I think it was 44 \\n\\nhours, 2 minutes and 57 seconds.    So, do you recall that was one of the subjects that \\n\\nyou discussed in October? \\n\\nA.      [9:38:56] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:38:57] Now, there was another topic that was discussed during that period \\n\\nand that had to do with certain testimony that had -- of certain witnesses during the \\n\\nmain trial.    They wanted to question you about three witnesses who had testified \\n\\nslightly differently than you had in the Ruto and Sang trial.    Do you recall that? \\n\\nA.      [9:39:28] I recall, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:39:34] In fact, Mr Steynberg questioned you a little bit on direct examination \\n\\non that, do you recall that? \\n\\nA.      [9:39:40] I recall, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:39:42] Right.    And just so that we\\'re clear, as I understand it, you had \\n\\ntestified on June 18 to June 20, 2014, over a period of three days, 18.6.2014 to 20.6.2014.     \\n\\nWould that be about right? \\n\\nA.      [9:40:24] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:40:25] Okay.    And just as an aside, just as an aside, because we will get to \\n\\n25.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 3   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-057-Red-ENG WT 25-02-2022 4/120 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                              (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS:    KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nthis topic later, the conversations that were captured between you and person number \\n\\n12 - as a result of the Prosecutor\\'s asking the Dutch government to monitor those \\n\\ntelephone conversations - were from June 5, 2014 and August 18, 2014.    Would that \\n\\nbe about right to your recollection? \\n\\nA.      [9:41:01] It\\'s not right, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:41:04] Okay.    All right.    We\\'ll get to that.     \\n\\nIn any event, during this four-day period in -- last year, in October 2021, you had an \\n\\nopportunity to give your explanations concerning what witness number -- person \\n\\nnumber 8, person number 14, and, I believe, it was person number 30 had testified in \\n\\ncourt.    Do you recall that? \\n\\nA.      [9:41:50] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:41:51] And we can find your answers, your explanations, we can find them, \\n\\nas I\\'m sure you\\'ve read them, on tab -- tab 45.   \\n\\nA.      [9:42:13] Which binder, your Honour? \\n\\nQ.      [9:42:15] Binder 2.    And it\\'s KEN-OTP-0160-0609, that\\'s tab 45?    And when \\n\\nyou have it, let us know. \\n\\nA.      [9:43:06] I have it, your Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [9:43:07] Okay.    Now, is this one of the documents that you had a chance to \\n\\nreview over the three- or four-day period before coming court to testify? \\n\\nA.      [9:43:18] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:43:24] Okay.    So before coming here today, you had a chance to read it, to \\n\\nread your answers? \\n\\nA.      [9:43:34] In the morning?   \\n\\nQ.      [9:43:36] Not today, this morning, but last week when -- when they gave you all \\n\\nthese documents and they were there questioning you and telling you what to expect \\n\\n25.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 4   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-057-Red-ENG WT 25-02-2022 5/120 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                              (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS:    KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nin coming here, you read this document? \\n\\nA.

[09:44:01] Okay. \\n\\nA.      [09:44:02] It was refreshed. \\n\\nQ.      [9:44:03] All right.    Now -- and just so you know where we\\'re going with this, \\n\\nyou can find your answers to the questions that were asked of you back in -- in \\n\\nOctober 2021, you will find them on pages 4, 5 and 6, starting with \\n\\nparagraphs -- starting with paragraphs 12 and going all the way to paragraph 25, and \\n\\nthat would be -- just to read the KEN numbers in, it\\'s KEN-OTP-0160-0612, 0613 and \\n\\n0614.    All right? \\n\\nA.      [9:45:04] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:45:05] Okay.    Now if we could -- and by the way, all of this, as I understand \\n\\nit, this is already in evidence, but if you need to go and look -- look at this to refresh \\n\\nyour memory as I go along, feel free.    But essentially I\\'m going to just read to you \\n\\nportions of what these witnesses have said and to give you an opportunity to give \\n\\nwhatever response you feel necessary and then the Court will decide who is right, \\n\\nwho is wrong, what to believe, what not to believe and what have you.    Okay?   \\n\\nA.      [9:45:57] Thank you, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:45:57] Okay.    So we\\'ll start with person number 8, person number 8.

Do you see that? \\n\\nA.      [9:48:02] Who testified? \\n\\nQ.      [9:48:03] Well, the person number 8.    We\\'re talking about -- this is the \\n\\ntestimony -- I apologise.    Let me -- what you\\'re looking at is a transcript of the \\n\\ntrial -- of the main trial, Ruto and Sang.    And if you look up at the left-hand side at \\n\\nthe very top, it gives the person\\'s number in that trial.    And for today\\'s purposes, \\n\\nthat person is number 8.

Thank you.     \\n\\nNow I\\'m going to start mid -- mid-sentence on line 2:   \\n\\n\"On that day, I met [person number 63 in our case] for the first time and we discussed \\n\\nthe matter.

At the time that [the] fabricated information -- at the \\n\\ntime [that] the three of you, according to you, decided to put the fabricated \\n\\ninformation in your statement, who came up with the story?    Who came up with the \\n\\nfabricated story?   \\n\\nI want you to understand the difference I\\'m making now.    It is one thing to say, well, \\n\\nhere is a story we\\'re looking at, put it in his statement.    It is another matter for \\n\\nsomebody to be the one that came up with that story to begin with that needed to be \\n\\nput in the statement. \\n\\nSo what I want to understand from you now is who -- whose idea was it?

[10:16:31] He\\'s lying, your Honour.    And I can add, this witness met \\n\\ninvestigators before me and I never knew that he was already called and I never knew \\n\\nwhat information investigators needed, so I couldn\\'t say anything about -- because I \\n\\ndidn\\'t know what -- I didn\\'t know what information the investigators are -- are \\n\\nwant -- they want.    So he was lying, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:17:01] All right.    And I take it you also stand by, you know, the information \\n\\nthat you provided the Prosecutor in October 2021 in your statement for more -- for a \\n\\nmore complete answer to the -- to this particular witness, right? \\n\\nA.      [10:17:20] What did you say? \\n\\nQ.      [10:17:22] Of course you already discussed this with the Prosecutor in October, \\n\\nso you also stand by that -- \\n\\nA.      [10:17:30] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:17:31] Okay.    All right.   \\n\\nA.      [10:17:31] Thank you. \\n\\nQ.      [10:17:33] I deliberately did not read everything that you said to save some time.   \\n\\nHer Honour is going to have that information, but feel free to elaborate as much as \\n\\nyou want on anything.    So don\\'t let me limit you to a yes or a no.    Okay? \\n\\nA.      [10:17:50] Thank you, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:17:50] You\\'re welcome.     \\n\\nNow if we could go to tab 86, tab 86.

[10:18:19] Now if we turn to page 18, if we turn to page 18.   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:18:25] Sorry, just for clarity, we\\'re still looking at \\n\\nthe testimony of witness number 30 on the list, is it?   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:18:31] That\\'s correct, that\\'s correct.     \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    Thank you.   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:18:33] Yes.    Thank you, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:18:36] So this is the same person, person number 30.

[10:18:51] Okay, all right.     \\n\\nNow if I could direct your attention to line 6, line 6 and I\\'ll read -- I\\'m trying to read as \\n\\nslowly as I can so we get the translation properly.     \\n\\nQuestion:    \"And bearing in mind you had never lived in location number 1, what do \\n\\nyou think would happen if investigators went to location number 1 and asked the \\n\\npeople living there if they knew you?\" \\n\\nAnswer:    \"It would be a mistake. \\n\\nA mistake by who? \\n\\nOn my part.\" \\n\\nQuestion:    \"And the investigators found that you did not, in fact, live in location \\n\\nnumber 1, do you think you still would have\" -- \"you still would have got all the \\n\\nbenefits you were expecting?\" \\n\\n25.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 19   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-057-Red-ENG WT 25-02-2022 20/120 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                              (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS:    KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nAnswer:    \"Well, you know, based on what they told me -- well, let me explain.   \\n\\nThey told me all those things because investigations had been carried out at location \\n\\n4.\" \\n\\nAnd for our purposes, location number 4 is location number 12 on our list.    Location \\n\\nnumber 12 on our list.    So if you want to look at location -- location number 12, so \\n\\nyou can -- you know what they\\'re -- they\\'re talking about.    Okay? \\n\\nA.      [10:20:47] Yes, your Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:20:48] Okay. \\n\\n\"If the investigation had been carried out correctly, they would have gone to where \\n\\nwe were\" and all -- \"and in all the surrounding areas, but these people told me that\", \\n\\nquote, \"\\'Those other people are very far away, they will not come here,\\'\" and it is not \\n\\nfor that -- \"and it is for that reason that we gave that statement the way we did.\" \\n\\nQuestion:    \"All right.    Let me just clarify two things:    Firstly, [...] you say \\'they told \\n\\nme,\\' you\\'re referring to person [number] 1\" - that is you - \"and 3\"   - that is person 63 \\n\\nin our case - \"is that right?\"     \\n\\nAnswer:      \"Yes.     \\n\\nYou then you said that \\'They told me ... those things because investigations had been \\n\\ncarried out\" -- \"because investigations had been carried out at location 4.\"    That is \\n\\nlocation 12.    Answer -- \"Is that what you meant to say, location [number] 4 on the \\n\\nPIS?\"    That is local number 12.   \\n\\n\"Yes.\" \\n\\nSo do you wish to comment on this at all? \\n\\nA.      [10:22:31] Yes, your Honour.    I can say these people were lying, and after they \\n\\nreceived bribery and they change all the statement and they change all things to put \\n\\nme because I didn\\'t receive a bribery. \\n\\n25.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 20   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-057-Red-ENG WT 25-02-2022 21/120 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                              (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS:    KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nQ.

So if you could look at the list, look at the list and see \\n\\nwhether you -- just to remind us whether you recognise this person, whether you \\n\\nknow this person.   \\n\\nA.      [10:23:21] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:23:25] Okay.    And you know him quite well? \\n\\nA.      [10:23:26] Not quite well.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:23:27] Okay.     \\n\\nA.      [10:23:28] I know him, as I told the investigators earlier. \\n\\nQ.      [10:23:31] Okay.    You were talking to him, he was talking to you during this \\n\\nperiod, during the period of say 2011, 2012, 2013? \\n\\nA.      [10:23:42] Not quite, unless we need advices from the project we had, that is \\n\\nhow we were communicating. \\n\\nQ.      [10:23:49] Okay.    So let\\'s look at tab 82.

Yesterday I said that in April last year 2013, I was approached \\n\\nby a certain lady, who told me that she was --\" that she had been -- that \"she had some \\n\\nconnection[s] with -- with the ICC.

And he says:    \"I was \\n\\n[with organisation number 15] supporter, she approached me and told me she was \\n\\nspeaking with some people from -- from the ICC.    Then she told me that they were \\n\\nlooking for some more witnesses because the key witnesses at the time had started \\n\\nwithdrawing so that the ICC was looking for some witnesses to go and testify.    And \\n\\nthen she told me that the main intention was to -- to victimise the two parties, William \\n\\nRuto and Joshua Sang, in the post-election violence that took place in 2007-2008.     \\n\\nThen she told me that once you are a witness, you\\'re going to be able to get a lot of \\n\\nsupport.

[10:27:37] Yes, your Honour.    This person number 14, I never knew even when \\n\\nhe met with ICC.    I didn\\'t have any connection and I didn\\'t know.

And \\n\\nfrom what I see, the second page, that is, page 64 that you are talking about following \\n\\n65, 76, yes, and 77, that\\'s a different witness. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:30:08] Okay.    I -- I see the mix-up and I -- okay, let me try to \\n\\nclarify.    Try to clarify.    And I stand corrected.    The first page relates to person \\n\\nnumber -- number 14 and that probably, in my haste, I put it in a wrong pile. \\n\\nQ.      [10:30:33] So the part that I have quoted with you, Madam, the part that we just \\n\\ndiscussed, that I just read, that relates to person number 8, okay?    So it wasn\\'t \\n\\nperson -- we\\'re going to get to person number 14, but this person, right now we\\'re \\n\\ndealing with person number 8, so this is what person number 8 said, okay?     \\n\\nNow if you could first look at the list and see whether you know person number 8.   \\n\\nA.      [10:31:13] Which tab? \\n\\nQ.

[10:31:34] Well, I\\'m not asking you to go to another page, but we\\'re referring to \\n\\nperson number 8 and I was asking you to look at that list of names -- \\n\\nA.      [10:31:42] Yes, I know, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:31:44] Okay.

[10:31:54] But the portion that I read to you came when person number 8 was \\n\\ntestifying in the Ruto and Sang case and this is what he\\'s saying about you.

[10:32:14] He was lying, and after getting the bribe, he changed everything.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:32:18] All right.     \\n\\nA.      [10:32:19] To discredit me. \\n\\nQ.

Because you say the Prosecution \\n\\nrecord, are you suggesting that anything the Prosecutor says is correct, that we have \\n\\nto accept? \\n\\nA.      [10:34:59] They have the record showing who recruited that person, who \\n\\nintroduced that person number 8 -- who recruited person number -- is it number --   \\n\\nQ.      [10:35:15] Yeah, number 8.    Number 8.    Number 8 is saying that you recruited \\n\\nhim.   \\n\\nA.      [10:35:25] Number 8, yes, I recruited him, but I didn\\'t recruited, I just gave out \\n\\nthe number and, then, from there, I don\\'t know what was happening, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:35:37] Okay.    All right.    All right, thank you.     \\n\\nIf -- if we can go to tab 87, tab 87, still in third binder.    And now we\\'re going to get to \\n\\nperson number 14.

[10:37:25] All right.     \\n\\nAnswer:    \"Your Honour, since the first recording that we mentioned the name \\n\\nGicheru, that is when I discovered that the name\" -- \"that the name that is supposed to \\n\\nbe used in this discussion was Gicheru.    That is why we mention Gicheru, Gicheru at \\n\\nthe -- all the time.\" \\n\\nIf we go to the next page. \\n\\nQuestion:    \"And when you\\'re saying, Mr Witness, \\'Gicheru will complete it,\\' will \\n\\ncomplete what?\"   \\n\\nAnswer:    \"Your Honour, we were talking about completing an issue that was not \\n\\nthere.\"    Just fabricating -- \"Just fabrication for how to get money.\" \\n\\nQuestion:    \"Complete what, Mr Witness?    What was Gicheru supposed to \\n\\ncomplete?\"     \\n\\nAnswer:    \"Your Honour, I told you that I don\\'t know Gicheru, neither I\\'ve never \\n\\nseen\" -- \"neither I\\'ve never seen her -- him, but the discussion was well-planned so \\n\\nthat you can release money -- the investigators can release money to [that] lady.\" \\n\\nThe lady being you.   \\n\\nA.      [10:39:07] Your Honour, it\\'s not true.    And the name Gicheru, I got it from him \\n\\nand he was the one, according to the recording, I recorded him, the picture is proving \\n\\nthat he was the one talking about Gicheru.    I told you before I never met Gicheru, I \\n\\nnever talked to him.    So they had -- he\\'s the one who brought this whole issue saying \\n\\nthey want you to go back and already money is there and the recording is there.   \\n\\n25.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 27   \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-057-Red-ENG WT 25-02-2022 28/120 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                              (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS:    KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nThank you, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.

[10:39:48] Now during the course of your involvement with the OTP, yesterday \\n\\nwe saw where you were communicating with witnesses, at one point, they had told \\n\\nyou to stop it or they had asked you who had tasked you.    The OTP investigators \\n\\nhad in fact asked you to tape-record all of your conversations, had they not? \\n\\nA.      [10:40:14] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:40:16] And at some point -- you know, and they provided you with the \\n\\nmeans to tape-record? \\n\\nA.      [10:40:21] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:40:22] Sometimes it was the tape-recorder aside and sometimes I think it was \\n\\nbuilt into the phone, as I understand it? \\n\\nA.      [10:40:29] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:40:31] And so -- and we see from the disclosure material from the \\n\\nProsecution quite a few tape recordings from you and I -- so I don\\'t doubt that.    And \\n\\nfrom my disclosure material, it appears that you had a Sony device -- a Sony audio \\n\\nand a Technobile.    Does that ring a bell?    I mean, the two different phones? \\n\\nA.      [10:41:04] Yes, your Honour.    I had -- \\n\\nQ.      [10:41:07] Provided to you by the OTP? \\n\\nA.      [10:41:09] It was a mobile. \\n\\nQ.      [10:41:11] Yeah.   \\n\\nA.

[10:42:59] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:43:00] Okay.

[10:43:13] I hand it over, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:43:15] Right.

[10:43:40] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:43:41] All right.

It\\'s not like I could -- \\n\\nQ.      [10:44:11] I understand, Madam.    I\\'m not suggesting at this stage, at this stage, \\n\\nthat for some reason or other you were not recording, but what I am suggesting is \\n\\nthat -- or what I can see from here is that when they were able to prove that you were \\n\\nhaving unrecorded conversations, you would at least inform them that, \"Yes, I had \\n\\nso-and-so call me from this number,\" and since it wasn\\'t recorded, you would \\n\\nvolunteer what you recalled from that conversation? \\n\\nA.      [10:44:55] I have volunteered, your Honour, and tell -- give the whole \\n\\ninformation, I was. \\n\\nQ.      [10:45:00] Right.   \\n\\nA.      [10:45:00] They ask. \\n\\nQ.

Because as we\\'ll see later, when we get to the recorded \\n\\nconversations that you had with person number 12 - when you did not know that you \\n\\nwere being recorded - there, we can see, you know, the discussion, we can see what \\n\\nnumber 12 said, we can see what you said, we can see who is saying what to whom.   \\n\\nBut in this instance when we don\\'t have those recordings, all we have is what you \\n\\nrepresented to the Prosecutors as to what the discussion was about when so-and-so \\n\\ncalled you, and, for whatever reason, that conversation was not recorded? \\n\\nA.

The witness has acknowledged that, yes, those -- you know, there \\n\\nwere times when she did not record.     \\n\\nNow at some point, we\\'re going to be mentioning this in our final brief.    If you think \\n\\nit\\'s necessary for us to at least read into the record those documents, which are \\n\\nalready in, or where we think, you know, there\\'s an indication that it wasn\\'t recorded, \\n\\nI could do so. \\n\\nIf you think it\\'s not necessary because the documents are already in and then we can \\n\\nsimply make references to it, considering that we have -- already have the admission \\n\\nfrom the witness.    My concern is, that at some point, at some point the Prosecution \\n\\ndoesn\\'t say, \"Well, you didn\\'t put this to the witness.    You didn\\'t put this particular \\n\\ndocument to the witness.\"     \\n\\nSo, I mean, I see we\\'re getting close to the -- the lunch break.    This can be -- I mean \\n\\nthe morning break.    We don\\'t have to resolve this issue right now.    We can come \\n\\nback.    I can move on to the next section and then --   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:49:03] But maybe if I just ask, and the documents \\n\\nyou are talking about, are they already on the record? \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:49:07] They\\'re already on the record. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:49:09] So why not make references to them so \\n\\nthat --   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:49:10] I can --   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:49:12] -- you know, they remain on the record. \\n\\n25.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 32   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-057-Red-ENG WT 25-02-2022 33/120 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                              (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS:    KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:49:15] I could -- I could do that right now.

And that probably will take us to the break \\n\\nbecause there are quite a few but ...   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [10:49:24] Your Honour, I\\'m in your hands, but if I can maybe \\n\\nshortcut the process.    The documents as I understand it my learned friend\\'s referring \\n\\nto are the witness statements of this witness where she mentions instances that she \\n\\nhad conversations, and the witness statements states this was not recorded for \\n\\nwhatever reason. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:49:42] Yes.    I just want for him to refer us to, you \\n\\nknow --   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [10:49:45] Right.     \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:49:45] -- the various documents and which \\n\\nsections he is talking about, maybe lines or something like that. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [10:49:53] All I wish to state is that the Prosecution doesn\\'t \\n\\ndispute that if that\\'s in the statement. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:49:59] Okay.    I\\'ll just read the -- I\\'ll proceed as instructed.   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:50:03] Thank you, Mr Karnavas. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:50:05] Yes.

[11:33:09] If we could turn to tab 38, tab 38.    And that\\'s in volume 2, binder 2, \\n\\ntab 38.    This is sort of a subsection of the issue of phones. \\n\\nAre you there? \\n\\nA.      [11:34:03] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [11:34:05] Okay.    Now, this morning I touched on -- a little bit on this issue of \\n\\nphones and whether you had phones that you were not supposed to have and \\n\\nwhether you were communicating with folks when you were not supposed to be \\n\\ncommunicating.    So this -- this part of my cross-examination deals with that, but first \\n\\nsort of a -- a preliminary matter with -- on this topic is found on tab 38.    If we look at \\n\\nthe second -- the third paragraph, it says you were asked if you\\'re still in contact with \\n\\nother witnesses, and they list a number of witnesses, and you were told to stop \\n\\ncontacting people in Kenya. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [11:35:03] Sorry, your Honour, can we just have a date on this, \\n\\nplease. \\n\\n25.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 36   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-057-Red-ENG WT 25-02-2022 37/120 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                              (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS:    KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [11:35:08] Yeah, you\\'re absolutely right.    It\\'s a document that I \\n\\nreceived from the Prosecution that\\'s filed on 12/10/2013.     \\n\\nQ.      I wish to, for the record, just to show that you have been -- it would appear that \\n\\nyou were contacting witness on your own and -- from this document, and you were \\n\\ntold to stop doing that.    Would that be correct?   \\n\\nA.      [11:35:37] Your Honour, I was having my Kenyan phone number and they were \\n\\nusing that call to call me and they -- we used that Kenyan number. \\n\\nQ.      [11:35:48] But in here, it seems to indicate that you were told to stop \\n\\ncommunicating with -- with individuals? \\n\\nA.      [11:35:53] But my phone was on, your Honour, and they could call and ... \\n\\nQ.      [11:35:59] \"... she was told to stop contacting people in Kenya,\" so here it appears \\n\\nthat you were contacting others in Kenya.    So would you acknowledge that that was \\n\\ngoing on?    Or did the investigator who wrote this report, did he just make that up?   \\n\\nIs he lying?   \\n\\nA.      [11:36:22] No, your Honour, he\\'s not lying. \\n\\nQ.      [11:36:27] Okay.    All right.    And incidentally, although it was filed \\n\\non -- on -- yeah, it was filed 10/12, and this is -- it\\'s about October 12, 2013 when you \\n\\ngot this message. \\n\\nA.      [11:36:41] And I gave them the number. \\n\\nQ.      [11:36:42] I understand.    Ma\\'am, there\\'s no need to get defensive.

[11:37:42] So you had testified and you were still in The Hague at the time? \\n\\nA.      [11:37:45] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [11:37:46] Okay.

So from 2014, for instance, when the Prosecution became \\n\\naware of this, they didn\\'t bother to ask you in 2015, \\'16, \\'17, \\'18, \\'19, \\'20, \\'21, all those \\n\\nyears went by and the Prosecutor never contacted you to ask you what exactly you \\n\\nwere saying in these communications, right? \\n\\nA.      [11:38:42] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [11:38:44] All right.    Now if you look at page 44, if we could -- we see some \\n\\ninitials, by the way, and I think we can -- we agreed yesterday, but just again to \\n\\nremind ourselves, you see your initials there, right? \\n\\nA.      [11:39:09] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [11:39:10] And we see -- we see the initials of the person -- of person number 12? \\n\\nA.      [11:39:16] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [11:39:17] Okay.

It\\'s \\n\\na \"yes\" or a \"no\", or \"I will explain\".    But give me whether you were allowed to or not \\n\\nallowed to first.   \\n\\nA.      [11:40:23] I was not allowed.    But I will explain, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [11:40:26] Okay, please do.   \\n\\nA.      [11:40:29] After I testified and I was so lonely and I thought those people were \\n\\nin protection programme because they never told that they are out. \\n\\nQ.      [11:40:43] Yes? \\n\\nA.      [11:40:44] So, and I feel like talking to someone because I couldn\\'t get in touch \\n\\nback home and I thought of, let me just talk to them because I was in a country which \\n\\nI can\\'t speak the language. \\n\\nQ.      [11:41:01] Okay.   \\n\\nA.      [11:41:01] And I can\\'t speak to Victim Witness Unit unless if I need something.   \\n\\nSo the only -- I say, Okay, they are in here and they are getting contact, I say let me \\n\\njust have a chat with them, thinking that they were in the protection.

[11:42:42] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [11:42:43] Okay.    And of course all of this -- all of this, all of this you told the \\n\\nProsecutor in -- in October 2021.    You explained all of this.    What you just told us, \\n\\nyou also told this to the Prosecutor in October 2021? \\n\\nA.      [11:43:08] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [11:43:09] Okay.    Now that is in evidence, so we don\\'t need to hear that \\n\\nexplanation again, but thank you for offering it.    Is there anything else, something \\n\\nnew that you haven\\'t shared, that you thought about, that might have escaped your \\n\\nattention that you would want to give as an explanation?

Is there anything else you wish \\n\\nto share with us on that at this point? \\n\\nA.      [11:44:37] The only thing I want to share is like everything I said there, it wasn\\'t \\n\\naccurate, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [11:44:46] Okay.    What you\\'re -- in other words, what you were saying when \\n\\nyou were not being listened into was not accurate? \\n\\nA.      [11:44:53] Not -- what I\\'m saying is when I was talking to him, because I know \\n\\nhis agenda was to make me to leave the ICC, and that is the time now I wanted to \\n\\nknow much more about him.     \\n\\nQ.      [11:45:01] Okay.   \\n\\nA.      [11:45:02] So I had to say something, so he can give me the information because \\n\\nI -- I\\'d been talking to him when I was in location number...      Mm...    I talked to him \\n\\nwhen I was in location number 12, but he never mention he\\'s out of programme.   \\n\\nAnd he talked to me before and he mentioned to me that when are you joining, when \\n\\nI wasn\\'t even a witness.    So for me, I thought he was really in the protection, but I \\n\\ndidn\\'t know that he was having another agenda that want me to -- to move out of \\n\\nprotection and go to asylum seeking.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:45:59] Okay.    All right.    Well, that\\'s what we\\'re going to discuss a little bit \\n\\ndown the road, but let me just make sure that I fully understand what you\\'re telling \\n\\nus.    And let me begin by -- by saying or asking you, you had already testified, right? \\n\\nA.      [11:46:17] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [11:46:18] Okay.

[11:46:39] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [11:46:40] As we will see later on, the issue of adoption - and that was \\n\\nthe -- your -- you -- word that was used, was something that was discussed between \\n\\nyou and person number 12, right? \\n\\nA.      [11:46:56] Because --   \\n\\nQ.      [11:46:57] Because -- because it had come up in court, you were questioned on it.   \\n\\nIn fact, the presiding judge asked you some questions, right?    So that was one of the \\n\\ntopics of conversations, right, when you were in The Hague? \\n\\nA.      [11:47:14] It was not a judge who ask, it was the -- \\n\\nQ.      [11:47:15] All right.    Very well.   \\n\\nA.      [11:47:16] -- defence -- defence lawyer ask. \\n\\nQ.      [11:47:19] All right.    And during this period, there was also the issue of \\n\\nrelocation, right? \\n\\nA.      [11:47:26] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [11:47:27] Okay.    So there were all these issues in the air and, as I understand it, \\n\\nyour accommodations were being paid for by the ICC? \\n\\nA.      [11:47:42] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [11:47:43] And though you may not have had many communications with \\n\\nthe -- the OTP and it looks like they were not communicating with you after you \\n\\ntestify, you were in constant communication with the folks from the witness \\n\\nand -- the Victims and Witness Section, right? \\n\\nA.

Again, \\n\\nwe can see your initials and we can see person number 12, so you\\'re talking to him.     \\n\\nLine 332, I\\'ll just read:    \"They will betray me.\"     \\n\\nHe says: \"They have to give you some privacy.\" \\n\\nNow when you say, \"They will betray me\", who you are talking?    Who will betray \\n\\nyou?    And who should be giving you privacy? \\n\\nA.      [11:56:44] Your Honour, yes, I talked about that but it wasn\\'t meant.    I was just \\n\\ntalking for the sake of keep -- to keep conversation going on. \\n\\nQ.      [11:57:01] I understand.    You\\'ve told us that many, many times.   \\n\\nA.      [11:57:04] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [11:57:04] And I don\\'t mean to be disrespectful, but I\\'m asking you a very direct \\n\\nquestion.    When you say, \"They will betray me.\"    My question was, who is they?   \\n\\nOkay?    I\\'m not asking the why, you may -- you answered the way you did, but I\\'m \\n\\nasking, who is they?    If you could tell us. \\n\\nA.      [11:57:27] There was nobody, your Honour.    I was just talking for the sake, to \\n\\nkeep conversation going on. \\n\\nQ.      [11:57:34] Okay.    So when you\\'re saying here, \"They will betray me,\" is sort of \\n\\nlike big brother or big sister, somebody out there in the stratosphere is going to betray \\n\\nyou? \\n\\nA.      [11:57:44] As I\\'ve told you, I wasn\\'t referring to anyone.    I was just -- it was -- I \\n\\nwas just saying it. \\n\\nQ.      [11:57:50] Okay.

And if you -- I don\\'t want \\n\\nyou to speculate, if you don\\'t know what he\\'s talking about, just tell me that you\\'re \\n\\nreferring to somebody and he\\'s saying something else.    Who is \"they\"?   \\n\\nA.      [11:58:12] For him, he was referring because he was against the VWU and ICC \\n\\nstaff.     \\n\\nQ.      [11:58:15] Okay.    All right.   \\n\\nA.      [11:58:16] So everything for him was like they are not good, so leave these \\n\\npeople alone.    Come out of -- \\n\\nQ.      [11:58:25] Okay.    All right.    And you say on line 343:    \"Yes, they want to \\n\\nknow all my movements.\"    Again, it\\'s the \"they\", who is they?    Who are you \\n\\nreferring to \"they\" over here? \\n\\nA.      [11:58:42] I was just saying it again, your Honour, I didn\\'t refer anyone.    I was \\n\\njust saying to keep the conversation going on.    But I didn\\'t refer anybody. \\n\\nQ.      [11:58:53] Okay.    We have to slow down a little bit, you know.   \\n\\nA.      [11:58:57] Thank you. \\n\\nQ.      [11:58:58] For the wonderful language assistants here. \\n\\nWhen he says:    \"They have to give you some privacy\", you seem to know exactly \\n\\nwho he\\'s referring to.    And he\\'s referring to VWU.    And so I -- I just want to put to \\n\\nyou very straightforwardly that when you say on line 343: \"Yes, they want to know all \\n\\nmy movements\", you\\'re referring to \"they\" as VWU wanting to know all your \\n\\nmovements, are you not? \\n\\nA.      [11:59:37] But -- \\n\\nQ.      [11:59:40] Are you not?    It\\'s a \"yes\", it\\'s a \"no\", it\\'s \"I don\\'t know\", it\\'s \"I can\\'t \\n\\nremember.\"    Pick any one of those.   \\n\\nA.

Explain it again.    And, please, take your time.   \\n\\nA.      [11:59:58] Thank you.    My -- my explanation was, when I had this conversation \\n\\nwas like I wanted to keep on the conversation and explore more about this person \\n\\nbecause I never knew who he was.    I thought he was an ICC witness, but he was not.   \\n\\nAnd yeah, if I can say that. \\n\\nQ.      [12:00:29] Okay.    Now if I could refresh your memory a little bit, if I may, and I \\n\\nknow it\\'s only from yesterday, but yesterday there were a couple of instances when \\n\\nthis person\\'s name came up and I showed you a couple of documents, and it appears \\n\\nthat you tell the Prosecutors at one point, the investigators, that you had \\n\\na conversation with this person in 2011.    And then later on, I showed you \\n\\na document where in-between your first interview of December 1 and 2, 2012, and I \\n\\nbelieve it was July 2013, sandwiched in-between there, you informed them that this \\n\\nperson had called you from The Hague.

[12:01:44] No, I -- well, if I -- if I could conduct the questioning, we\\'ll go a lot \\n\\nquicker. \\n\\nI just want to -- the point that I\\'m trying to make is, you knew this person -- \\n\\n25.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 49   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-057-Red-ENG WT 25-02-2022 50/120 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                              (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS:    KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nA.      [12:01:55] Before ICC. \\n\\nQ.      [12:01:56] -- before ICC.    You knew him in 2011.    And in 2013, does he not ask \\n\\nyou a question point blank:    \"Why aren\\'t you here with us in The Hague?\"    Right?   \\n\\nRemember that exchange? \\n\\nA.      [12:02:12] It was different location, your Honour.    You are putting as if it was --   \\n\\nQ.      [12:02:16] The point I\\'m trying to make is, you knew who he was.   \\n\\nA.      [12:02:20] Your Honour, I had stated that the person -- when I went into \\n\\nprotection in Kenya, I was -- I changed my number, the one he used to have it.    And \\n\\nwhen I came into location number, ah ... and I had a new number.    So he called me \\n\\nand I didn\\'t know who was -- who gave him the number.    And that is the time I \\n\\ninformed the investigators he has called and I was asked to record it, and I record it. \\n\\nQ.      [12:02:54] Well, I don\\'t know whether it was recorded or not, and I\\'m not \\n\\nsuggesting that --   \\n\\nA.      [12:02:58] I\\'m making clear that\\'s why I told them, so they were aware that I -- I \\n\\ntalked to that person.    But before, he was asking me, I was using a different number.   \\n\\nWhen I went into protection, I changed the number and the number which I was \\n\\nusing I handed over to Prosecution. \\n\\nQ.      [12:03:20] Are you finished? \\n\\nA.      [12:03:21] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:03:22] Okay.    Now, first of all, I\\'m not contesting that you didn\\'t have this \\n\\nconversation.    In fact, I\\'m insisting - and I\\'m glad that you recorded it, or at least you \\n\\npassed it on - because now you\\'re in The Hague, okay, and now you\\'re having these \\n\\nconversations with this individual.    And, as I indicated, there were 44-hours plus of \\n\\nconversations with him, so when you claim that you didn\\'t know who he was, or \\n\\nwhat his motive was, or what he was doing there, I put to you, Madam, that it doesn\\'t \\n\\n25.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 50   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-057-Red-ENG WT 25-02-2022 51/120 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                              (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS:    KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nring true? \\n\\nA.      [12:04:06] It\\'s -- it\\'s not true, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:04:09] Okay.    Very well.    So let\\'s go on with this, otherwise we\\'re going to \\n\\nbe here next week and I -- I want you to have an enjoyable weekend. \\n\\nSo we go to line 347, or line 345:    \"Because there is a line -- there is a line they are \\n\\nreally hiding.\"      \"... there is a line they are really hiding.\"     \\n\\nLine 347:    \"I was with them and they took that line away.    I was with them and they \\n\\ntook that line away.\"     \\n\\nWhen we\\'re talking about a \"line\", are we talking about a means of communication, if \\n\\nyou recall? \\n\\nA.      [12:05:02] If I can recall, your Honour, it doesn\\'t make sense, because nobody \\n\\ntook my line away, nobody took ... \\n\\nQ.      [12:05:11] Madam, Madam, whether it makes sense or not --   \\n\\nA.      [12:05:15] That\\'s why I was telling you things which I was saying wasn\\'t \\n\\naccurate, because nobody took my line away.    I was given and the one I ask, I use it \\n\\nand --   \\n\\nQ.      [12:05:24] Very well.   \\n\\nA.      [12:05:25] -- that was it. \\n\\nQ.

[12:06:03] I can\\'t recall, your Honour.    And I\\'ll explain also.    Because I was \\n\\nliving in a  -- in apartment and I didn\\'t have anything in there, it was only clothes, so \\n\\nthere was nothing to take it on.    The only thing I had is clothes and the phone, that \\n\\nwas it, your Honour.    So this conversation, I was just talking for the sake of keep \\n\\nconversation going.    I didn\\'t mean it. \\n\\nQ.      [12:06:29] Okay.    You\\'ve already told us that, so we can move a lot quicker \\n\\nbecause I have a lot of vignettes to go through. \\n\\nSo if we go to line 355, he asks:    \"How come they took the line?\" \\n\\nAnswer: \"I used to hide it because I use ... to talk to people at home, so I think they \\n\\ntook it when I had gone to use the bathroom.    There is one -- there is one called \\n\\nA.2.6\" - that\\'s the acronym - \"I think he is the one who took it because I had placed it \\n\\nsomewhere, but these people can search everywhere in the room.\" \\n\\nNow that was your answer, was it not?    Was it your answer?    Can we get -- can we \\n\\nestablish that? \\n\\nA.      [12:07:30] It was my answer, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:07:32] Okay.    Now, I\\'m sure you\\'re going to give me the same explanation, \\n\\nso can I move on? \\n\\nA.      [12:07:41] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:07:42] Okay.    Thank you.    And then on line 360:    \"[I put] it in my bag \\n\\nwhere I normally keep my clothes.\"     \\n\\nHe says: \"Okay.\" \\n\\nOkay.    \"I told them that the phone was not mine but the line is mine.\"    Let me read \\n\\nthat one more time: \"I told them that the phone was not mine but the line is mine.\" \\n\\nSo help me out here.

[12:08:45] Okay.    And it would appear -- it would appear from this that you \\n\\nhave not been honest with them because you say:    \"I told them that the phone was \\n\\nnot mine but the line is mine.\"    So in other words, I told them I don\\'t know about it, \\n\\nit\\'s not mine, but actually it is mine.     \\n\\nNow, yesterday, yesterday, you told us that on occasions, depending - I believe the \\n\\nword was circumstances - depending on circumstances, it\\'s okay to lie. \\n\\nWas this one of those circumstances? \\n\\nA.      [12:09:31] I didn\\'t mean that.    What I -- I meant was like if I am in protection \\n\\nand someone comes up and asks me something like, \"Where are you?\"    So I was \\n\\nreferring there.    Maybe the communication, you know I\\'m not an English, it is a \\n\\nlanguage I learn, so sometimes I might slip it.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:09:48] Okay.   \\n\\nA.      [12:09:49] Yeah, thank you. \\n\\nQ.      [12:09:50] All right.    Well, I will agree with you that - and, I think here, is where \\n\\nwe are in agreement - under the circumstances where somebody is trying to get you \\n\\nto reveal your true identity, you can lie about it.     \\n\\nBut surely you\\'re not saying -- surely you\\'re not saying that this is one of those \\n\\noccasions?    Here, this is just -- can we put this in the category of lies?    Can we put \\n\\nthis in the categories of lies?    \"Yes\", \"no\", \"maybe\", \"I don\\'t know.\"   \\n\\nA.      [12:10:17] Yes, and I can explain also. \\n\\nQ.      [12:10:19] Well, you just explained that to us.   \\n\\nA.      [12:10:22] Yes.

[12:15:39] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [12:15:40] And that -- and that all of this, all of this that you\\'re saying is a lie.

And here, we also see some other initials, \"MC\", and then -- so, \\n\\nobviously, you\\'re having -- there\\'s somebody else in this conversation.    As I read, \\n\\nmaybe that might ring a bell.     \\n\\nAnyway, line 351:    \"So that is it, we are here.

[12:27:46] It is a long time, but I can say I -- I agree.    I had conversations several \\n\\ntimes, but --   \\n\\nQ.      [12:27:56] Okay.    All right.    But you recall this one?     \\n\\nI don\\'t mean -- I don\\'t want to go into it too much, but do you recall having this one? \\n\\nA.      [12:28:05] I -- I remember.

[12:28:17] You\\'re right.   \\n\\nA.      [12:28:19] So the same as me.    I -- I don\\'t remember anything and I\\'m a not \\n\\ncomputer -- \\n\\nQ.      [12:28:22] Okay. \\n\\nA.      [12:28:23] -- yeah.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:28:24] But one thing I want to clarify, and maybe you can help us out here, \\n\\nwhen you were having these conversations with number 12, sometimes somebody \\n\\nelse would join in on that conversation, right? \\n\\nA.      [12:28:41] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\n25.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 62   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-057-Red-ENG WT 25-02-2022 63/120 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                              (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS:    KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nQ.      [12:28:41] Okay.    So there may be somebody with -- with number 12, or were \\n\\nthere also occasions when you would call number 12 and number 12 would call \\n\\nsomebody else and sort of you\\'re using the phones to communicate with a third party \\n\\nthrough phone number 12.    Was that also being used? \\n\\nA.      [12:29:04] Because he was with the wife, the children and the other family. \\n\\nQ.      [12:29:12] Okay.     \\n\\nA.      [12:29:09] Yes, your Honour.     \\n\\nQ.      [12:29:09] All right.    I just want to make sure, because we saw some initials and \\n\\nI gave the indication that your phone wasn\\'t being tapped, and so I wanted to clarify \\n\\nthat point.     \\n\\nNow if we could go on to another topic, it\\'s slightly different.    If we look at tab 1, tab \\n\\n1, and this is a recording.    It\\'s in binder 1, binder 1.    And this is a recording on 3 July \\n\\n2014. \\n\\nSo you go to binder -- go to binder number 1 and it\\'s tab 1.    And in this one, there\\'s \\n\\na variety of issues that we\\'re going to touch on, so ...   \\n\\nA.      [12:30:17] I\\'m in there, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:30:19] Okay.    All right.    So if you go to page 21, okay?    Page 21 in \\n\\nthis -- in this tab.    So it\\'s tab 1, page 21.    You\\'re talking with person number 12.    On \\n\\nline 675, he\\'s saying to you: \"I want you to make sure you start asking for money for \\n\\na holiday as from tomorrow.\" \\n\\nAnd you reply: \"They will come here tomorrow because they were going to send me \\n\\nmoney today, so I requested them to come at 3 so that I can ring -- so that I can ring to \\n\\ncheck if my children were given permission.\" \\n\\nFurther down, line 682: \"I will tell [this person] that I wanted to see him -- that I \\n\\nwanted to see him then [then] I\\'ll let him know about the holiday.\"     \\n\\n25.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 63   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-057-Red-ENG WT 25-02-2022 64/120 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                              (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS:    KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nSo it appears that he\\'s suggesting to you that you should be demanding VWU holiday \\n\\nmoney, because at some point there are references that, yeah, well, the white man \\n\\ngoes on holiday, why shouldn\\'t you since you\\'re over here, right? \\n\\nA.      [12:31:56] I don\\'t know, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:31:57] Okay.    And then you -- there\\'s a further -- there\\'s an exchange.    He \\n\\nsays, at some point in line 689, he says, not you, he says: \"She\\'s very stupid.\" \\n\\nAnd then do you know who he\\'s referring to from this conversation?    And I don\\'t \\n\\nwant a name, but do you know who he\\'s referring to?    Is this -- is it -- \\n\\nA.      [12:32:28] I don\\'t know, because the people who work in VWU are so many, so I \\n\\ndon\\'t remember who was referring to. \\n\\nQ.      [12:32:35] Right.    But what he was basically saying, that the person working for \\n\\nVWU was stupid? \\n\\nA.      [12:32:41] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:32:42] Okay.    And then you go on, because obviously from the conversation \\n\\nyou appear to know this person, on line 694: \"Let me tell you ...\" \\n\\n696: \"... she is afraid of me.\"     \\n\\n698: \"She is afraid of me since ...\"   \\n\\n700: \"I have realised from the way she talks to me.\"     \\n\\n702: \"She is afraid of me.\"     \\n\\n704: \"She opens the door for me.\" \\n\\nNext page, 708: \"When I get in and out of the car she opens the door for me, that is \\n\\nwhat I want.    [Laughing ...]\" \\n\\nDo you recall that exchange? \\n\\nA.      [12:33:36] Yes, your Honour, I exchanged words with him, but it doesn\\'t mean \\n\\nthat those things happened.     \\n\\n25.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 64   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-057-Red-ENG WT 25-02-2022 65/120 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                              (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS:    KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nQ.      [12:33:40] Okay. \\n\\nA.      [12:33:41] You can confirm with VWU nothing like that happened.    I was just \\n\\nmaking him to feel like I am in his side.     \\n\\nQ.      [12:33:47] Okay.   \\n\\nA.      [12:33:48] So he can tell me more information. \\n\\nQ.      [12:33:54] Okay.    Well ...   \\n\\nA.      [12:33:59] Nothing happened really. \\n\\nQ.      [12:34:01] I know.    But when you say something like that, so you could get \\n\\nmore information, it just raises a flag.    It sounds like there you are again -- \\n\\nA.      [12:34:10] To under --   \\n\\nQ.      [12:34:06] Let me finish.     \\n\\nA.      [12:34:07] No, to understand him.    That\\'s my point, your Honour.     \\n\\nQ.      [12:34:10] Oh, you\\'re trying -- oh, yes, okay.   \\n\\nA.      [12:34:11] Because I met him and I talked to him without knowing who he was.   \\n\\nFor me, I knew him he was an ICC witness.    But it wasn\\'t, your Honour.    That is my \\n\\npoint.    So making me to talk the same language as he were talking so he can reveal \\n\\neverything, because he was hiding from me that he -- he has already gone out of ...   \\n\\nQ.      [12:34:39] Okay.   \\n\\nA.      [12:34:39] Yeah.    So, for me, I was interested why this guy was hiding.    I had \\n\\nto use words so I can understand him proper.    That was it, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:34:49] Okay.    All right.    But I just -- I mean, my question was slightly \\n\\ndifferent.     \\n\\nWhen you said that you wanted to find more information, I just wanted to -- to clarify \\n\\nthat point - I think you might have clarified it - as to whether you were somehow like \\n\\nthe 007 we talked about yesterday, out there in the field trying to entice people to talk \\n\\n25.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 65   \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-057-Red-ENG WT 25-02-2022 66/120 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                              (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS:    KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nto you, to get information.

[12:35:30] For myself. \\n\\nQ.      [12:35:31] For yourself. \\n\\nA.      [12:35:32] Yes, so I understood, because I didn\\'t know him, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:35:38] Okay.    Okay.   \\n\\nA.      [12:35:41] Because communicating to him, I thought it was ICC witness \\n\\nprotection, your Honour.    And that\\'s why I was comfortable with him.     \\n\\nQ.      [12:35:46] Okay. \\n\\nA.      [12:35:47] But later on, when I learn what this was telling me to do, I think he \\n\\nwas -- he wanted to make trouble so I can be chased from the protection, \\n\\nyour Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:36:02] Okay.    All right.    Well, let me finish with this document and then \\n\\nI\\'m being -- I\\'m being guided by my colleague, so I might have to obey orders.

[12:44:51] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.

[12:49:57] Okay.    Go ahead.   \\n\\nA.      [12:49:57] Because I never left the programme, but for them this is the \\n\\nconversation was concerning, that they will be shocked.

I have a few documents to \\n\\ngo through.    So let me just cut to the quick. \\n\\nIt seems that you were questioned about the amount of money that was provided to \\n\\nyou by the OTP.    You were questioned about this in case -- in the -- in the main case, \\n\\ndo you recall that? \\n\\nA.      [12:58:09] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:58:10] Okay.    And -- and I believe the figure was -- was rather high, \\n\\nsomewhere in the neighbourhood -- in excess of 40,000 US dollars.    Do you recall \\n\\nthat? \\n\\nA.      [12:58:29] I don\\'t know, your Honour, because I was not given accounts.    I was \\n\\nliving in a different location and the children was living in different location.     \\n\\nQ.      [12:58:34] Okay. \\n\\nA.      [12:58:35] So I wasn\\'t aware how much and they -- \\n\\nQ.      [12:58:43] I understand that.    But when in court --   \\n\\nA.      [12:58:47] They mentioned the figure, but I -- \\n\\nQ.      [12:58:49] The mentioned the figure.

[12:59:04] Where is that, your Honour?    I can\\'t see. \\n\\nQ.      [12:59:09] Well, if    -- okay.    The document is -- \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [12:59:12](Overlapping speakers) and was that in \\n\\ndollars?    Did you say dollars?   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [12:59:15] In dollars.    In dollars.    In dollars.    I was hoping that \\n\\nwe could get an agreement.    But you\\'re right, Madam President.    I\\'m going to need \\n\\nabout five minutes to go through the documents.    Now it might be a good time -- it \\n\\nmight be a good time to -- to take a break (Overlapping speakers). \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [12:59:34] I mean, if -- you mean five minutes for the \\n\\ncompletion of your ...   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [12:59:46] For the -- oh, no, no, no.    Oh, no, Oh, no.    I won\\'t be \\n\\nable to complete my -- my cross-examination, because even though the witness is here, \\n\\nI can, you know, I can share, there\\'s a topic on money, there\\'s a topic on the \\n\\nadoption -- on the adoption.    There\\'s also some other vignettes, and, of course, \\n\\nthere\\'s some final stuff that I want to go through, there are lots of documents, \\n\\nand -- and I think this is very important in your understanding of her evidence and in \\n\\nassessing it.     \\n\\nSo I\\'m afraid I\\'m going to take some more time.    The Prosecutor did not bring any of \\n\\nthis in.    We\\'re bringing it in because I think it\\'s important for you to have a complete \\n\\npicture of this individual.    You\\'re hearing her explanations.    I\\'ll try to move it along \\n\\nrather quickly.    I\\'m trying to get her to not repeat her old mantra.    But she seems, \\n\\nyou know, to want to, so -- and I\\'m trying to be as -- as polite as I possibly can be and \\n\\n25.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 76   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-057-Red-ENG WT 25-02-2022 77/120 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                              (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS:    KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nnot aggressive. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [13:00:53] How long do you expect to go on? \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [13:00:57] Hopefully not -- well, your Honour, a lot of it depends \\n\\non the witness.    I mean, if the witness -- and if I were to say I\\'m going to take -- I \\n\\nneed half an hour and the witness then begins stalling because she doesn\\'t want to \\n\\nanswer the questions, then I\\'m not going to be able to get through my, you know, I \\n\\ncould -- I might have been able to get through most of it had she not given us all these \\n\\nexplanations, the same ones over and over again, and I don\\'t wish to cut her off.     \\n\\nSo if I can get some quicker answers, I might be able to finish in an hour, your Honour.   \\n\\nAnd I\\'m -- so, some topics may be covered in five minutes if I get cooperation.

If we look at the second page and we look at the total \\n\\namount - and I should have noted it - in the first page, you have a column that says \\n\\nUSD; that stands for US dollars.    And if you could just look at both the first and the \\n\\nsecond page to see the sort of expenses that are listed. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [14:33:33] Mr Karnavas? \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [14:33:35] Yes? \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [14:33:37] You say \"US dollars\", where is it?   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [14:33:42] There\\'s a column on the -- the second column on the ...   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [14:33:47] Oh, yes, I see it.    Thank you. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [14:33:49] Yes, it took me a while. \\n\\nQ.      [14:33:50] So on the left side, we have the dates and then we have the activity, \\n\\nand, then as we go on, the next column has the amounts -- the itemised amounts with \\n\\nsubtotals in the last column.    And so if you look at -- on -- from the first page, and \\n\\nthat\\'s KEN-OTP-0132-0002, and then -- so we see on that first page, accommodation, \\n\\nfood/beverage.   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [14:34:32] Are you there, Madam Witness? \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [14:34:35] It\\'s tab ...   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [14:34:38] Ninety-five. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [14:34:39] Tab 95 and it\\'s in binder 3. \\n\\n(Pause in proceedings) \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [14:34:58](Interpretation) Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [14:35:00] \\n\\nQ.

But if you could look at -- on the left side, where they list \\n\\nthings like accommodation, food, communication, passport and what have you, and \\n\\nthen go on to the next page, we see the same thing, so we have accommodation, \\n\\nmedical costs and so on.    And if you look at the far -- the far right, there is a total, \\n\\nwhich states $43,453.23 cents.   \\n\\nDo you see that?   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [14:35:58] Can you give the reference number, \\n\\nKEN-OTP- ...      Which page are you talking about?    The second page? \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [14:36:04] Well, the second page.    The second page is \\n\\nKEN-OTP-0132-0012. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [14:36:15] From my own document, tab 95, the second \\n\\npage is KEN-OTP-0132-0003 and the first page is 0002. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [14:36:29] If I may assist, your Honour.    He\\'s referring to the \\n\\nsecond-last page.    I think he\\'s probably not printed out the whole report, just the \\n\\nimportant bits. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [14:36:37] That could be it, that could be it. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [14:36:42] If you could guide the witness, please. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [14:36:46] Yes.

[14:37:45] Right.    And you were asked about it -- you were asked about it in the \\n\\nRuto and Sang case, in fact, and again, your answer was you weren\\'t shown all the \\n\\nspecifics.     \\n\\nBut the issue of $43,453.23 cents was raised in that case as well, right? \\n\\nA.      [14:38:10] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [14:38:15] All right, thank you.    We can move on to tab 96, binder 3.    So binder \\n\\n3, tab 96.    This next series of question has to deal with the topic of money. \\n\\nSo do you have it? \\n\\nA.      [14:38:49] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.

Your answer: I went. \\n\\nDid you provide the Prosecution with all the documents? \\n\\nAnd then you say:    Yes, they have. \\n\\nQuestion:    Was it only an affidavit signed by your sister? \\n\\nAnswer --   \\n\\nWas it only an affidavit signed by a sister? \\n\\nAnswer:    No, no.     \\n\\nQuestion:    There were other documents?     \\n\\nAnswer: Yes. \\n\\nDo you see that? \\n\\nA.

[15:00:19] Okay.    And at no time that I see here, did you take the opportunity to \\n\\nexplain to the Court then that in Kenya, you can just have your relatives\\' children, say \\n\\nthat you adopted them, and that\\'s okay until it\\'s formalised.    Nowhere -- there are no \\n\\nqualifications that I\\'ve been able to find.     \\n\\nSo my question is, did you qualify that in that case as you\\'re attempting to qualify in \\n\\nthis case?     \\n\\nIt\\'s a yes or it\\'s a no or I don\\'t remember.   \\n\\nA.

You can say I adopted them even though the formalities, you \\n\\nknow, the legal formalities haven\\'t been completed.\" \\n\\nDid you say anything like that in that trial because I haven\\'t found it in the transcript? \\n\\nA.      [15:01:25] No, no, your Honour, but I had an affidavit. \\n\\nQ.      [15:01:28] Okay, you had an affidavit.    And let me ask you this, did you ever \\n\\nproduce that affidavit in that trial? \\n\\nA.      [15:01:35] No, your Honour, because I had left the country and the whole \\n\\ndocument was in Kenya. \\n\\nQ.      [15:01:41] Okay.    And I take it that if you -- that you had an affidavit, it was \\n\\nprepared by a lawyer? \\n\\nA.      [15:01:51] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:01:55] And that lawyer had a name, right? \\n\\nA.      [15:01:57] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:01:59] And that lawyer had an office? \\n\\nA.      [15:02:01] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:02:02] And that lawyer had a telephone number that you could reach out \\n\\nand call? \\n\\nA.      [15:02:09] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:02:10] And not just you, but maybe VWU could reach out and call -- and call \\n\\nthat office or even visit that office?    Right? \\n\\nA.      [15:02:20] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.

Or her?   \\n\\nWhoever the lawyer was?    That\\'s what you\\'re saying? \\n\\nA.      [15:03:10] I communicated with him when we sign, when I was in Kenya.   \\n\\nWhen I left, I left the documents in there, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:03:17] Well, I guess -- well, let me put it to you this way, did this \\n\\nlawyer -- was it a man or a woman, if you recall? \\n\\nA.      [15:03:25] I don\\'t recall, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:03:27] Okay.    Did the lawyer prevent you from taking a copy of that \\n\\naffidavit because we seem to have heard this story before that affidavits are drafted \\n\\nand then they\\'re not allowed to have copies of it.    Did your lawyer by any chance \\n\\nprevent you from taking a copy of the affidavit, so at least you have some formal \\n\\ndocument to say, \"I\\'ve adopted these children\" or \"I\\'m in the process of adopting these \\n\\nchildren\" or \"I\\'m their legal guardian until the formal adoption goes -- placed.\"     \\n\\nDid you ever get a copy of that affidavit?     \\n\\nA.

I\\'m not \\n\\nasking about your sister and I\\'m not asking about the court.    You went to an office.   \\n\\nYou went to a lawyer.    Presumably you paid that lawyer to draft an affidavit.

[15:05:02] I hope my sister -- I -- I thought my sister was hand it over to the \\n\\nVWU, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:05:11] Okay.    Now, if we can look at document -- in tab 7, tab 7, that\\'s \\n\\nvolume 1, and this is sort of like an aside, but it\\'s something -- somewhat relevant I \\n\\nthink to our discussion.    It\\'s dated 17 July 2014, tab 7.    KEN-OTP-0157-2659, and \\n\\nwhen you have it, let me know and I want to -- I\\'m going to direct your attention to \\n\\npage 4, page 4, KEN-OTP-0157-2664.     \\n\\nA.

Now in line 111, you say:   \\n\\n\"Things are not good.    Even his followers who are\" going \"around will also be \\n\\narrested.    They wrote to recant their statements\" so \"they gave false information to \\n\\nthe OTP.    They\\'ll also be arrested.

[15:06:43] So my point in pointing this out, is, at the time when you \\n\\ntestified - because this is on or about your testimony - you were aware that giving \\n\\nfalse testimony in court was a crime for which you could be imprisoned up to five \\n\\nyears, right? \\n\\n25.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 94   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-057-Red-ENG WT 25-02-2022 95/120 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                              (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS:    KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nA.      [15:07:06] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:07:07] Okay.    If we go to tab 94, tab 94, in binder 3, binder 3? \\n\\nA.      [15:07:27] I\\'m in there. \\n\\nQ.      [15:07:29] Okay.    Here, we have an investigative report -- by the way, it\\'s \\n\\nKEN-OTP-0129-0546, it\\'s a report that was filed on 16 April 2014, right about the time \\n\\nthat this -- these events occurred, unlike the other ones that we\\'ve seen, where they\\'re \\n\\nfiled three or four years later or two years later, and it says here that these two \\n\\ninvestigators called you on 16 April 2014.    Do you see that?    That\\'s the very first \\n\\nline.   \\n\\nA.      [15:08:11] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:08:12] And then, if we go to the second part, that is -- where it says birth \\n\\ncertificates of children, you say -- you have been telling investigators that you have \\n\\nthree children.     \\n\\n\"She submitted copies of their birth certificates to the OTP through the Field Office \\n\\nin\" -- location number, I can never remember these locations, location number 30, \\n\\nokay, all right -- \"for their relocation process, and the OTP received them.\" \\n\\n\"However\" -- \"however\" -- you may want to follow this document here:   \\n\\n\"However, only one certificate\" -- and it mentions the name -- \"of the 3 certificates \\n\\nindicates that\" you are \"the mother.    The other 2 certificates\" - and they name the two \\n\\nindividuals - \"indicate that\" - your sister - \"is the mother.\"     \\n\\nThen it says you clarify that two children are biologically belonging to your sister.   \\n\\n\"However she became an official guardian for them through an affidavit made by \\n\\na lawyer.\"     \\n\\nThat\\'s what you\\'re telling us and that\\'s what it says over here, and it seems that\\'s \\n\\nwhat you were telling them at the time.     \\n\\n25.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 95   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-057-Red-ENG WT 25-02-2022 96/120 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                              (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS:    KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\n\"She could not tell investigators when the[se] 2 children officially became her children \\n\\nbut she said that she had submitted a copy of the affidavit to the Field Office in \\n\\nUganda.\"    In place number 30. \\n\\nSo at least as of April 16, 2004, it appears -- \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:10:32] \"2014\", Mr Karnavas.   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:10:33]   \\n\\nQ.      [15:10:33] 2014, 2014, it appears that they were looking for verification of what \\n\\nyou had been claiming, that you had three children. \\n\\nA.      [15:10:43] I had children before, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:10:45] Right.    And it appears that, at least, it was right around 16 April 2014 \\n\\nthat they first realised that your claims of having three children were -- well, actually, \\n\\nyou only had one, you were taking care of two others, but at least as of that time, the \\n\\nOTP had not been provided with anything official that you were -- that you had \\n\\nadopted the children.    Would that be fair?     \\n\\nHave I been -- that was a question.     \\n\\nAs of this time, you had not provided them with anything, the OTP, that is? \\n\\nA.      [15:11:33] They have it, your Honour.     \\n\\nQ.      [15:11:34] As of that time?

[15:12:49] Okay, now, if we could look at page 1, page 1, and we go to -- if I can \\n\\ndirect your attention to line 21.   \\n\\nA.      [15:13:02] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:13:03] And you say, \"What\" -- \"US\" - the unidentified speaker, because -- but \\n\\nwe can still see that you\\'re having a conversation with person number 12:     \\n\\n\"What happened, you left your kids behind?\"     \\n\\nAnd you say: \"I didn\\'t have anything I could do because they were on my neck.\" \\n\\n\"Okay.\" \\n\\nAnd then you say:    \"And I didn\\'t have the affidavit, I was left with the affidavit \\n\\nonly.\" \\n\\n\"Okay.\" \\n\\nThen you say: \"Defence people had demanded it.\" \\n\\n\"Okay.\" \\n\\n\"They were complaining that they wanted to see the ...

You didn\\'t have the affidavit with you, you never produced the \\n\\naffidavit at least to the Defence who was demanding it, and that for you to formalise \\n\\nat least -- to legalise the adoption process, you would need to go to Kenya. \\n\\nCorrect? \\n\\nA.      [15:14:58] It wasn\\'t hard to process, but because I left Kenya because of security, \\n\\nI -- I didn\\'t have time for that to do. \\n\\nQ.      [15:15:07] I understand.    That\\'s the explanation, that\\'s the excuse.    But my \\n\\nquestion goes to, you were asked a very concrete question, whether you had legally \\n\\ngone through the process of adoption.    It\\'s a very, very simple question, but very \\n\\ndirect and very precise.    And you said yes. \\n\\nA.      [15:15:25] Because I had already had children and I had already had an affidavit, \\n\\nso it was only the process and I wasn\\'t in -- in Kenya. \\n\\nQ.      [15:15:33] But here you\\'re admitting that you had to go back to Kenya to -- to the \\n\\ncourts to sign -- to go through a court proceeding and to be present, right?     \\n\\nA.      [15:15:43] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:15:44] So, in fact, you had not legally gone through the process.    Remember, \\n\\nwhen I said the truth, the whole truth, that\\'s what that part means, the whole truth.   \\n\\nNot half a truth because half a truth is half a lie.    So were you not half lying? \\n\\nA.      [15:16:01] I\\'m not a liar, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:16:03] Okay, I\\'m not saying that you are, but it seems that when you testified \\n\\nunder oath in court and when they asked you specifically --   \\n\\nA.      [15:16:10] I didn\\'t lie, your Honour, because I was with the investigators, I \\n\\ncouldn\\'t investigate to know the truth. \\n\\nQ.      [15:16:24] Okay.    All right.

The unidentified speaker says:     \\n\\n\"That you didn\\'t adopt the children, if you did where are the papers?\"     \\n\\n\"Yes, that is what the defence wanted they didn\\'t want the affidavit from the court.\"     \\n\\nThen, if we go down to line 51, you say: \\n\\n\"The protection people demanded adoption papers.\" \\n\\nYou see that? \\n\\nA.      [15:17:16] Yes, your Honour.    I had a conversation, but because this \\n\\nconversation came in, because they wanted me to leave the protection and leave the \\n\\nchildren so that they can arrange later to come.

And if we go to just 343, you say:   \\n\\n\"They told me that they will come and pick me up when they know that the children \\n\\nhave been given the permission to go.\" \\n\\nDo you have that section, ma\\'am? \\n\\nA.

[15:21:00] Okay, thank you. \\n\\nAll right.    I\\'m going to through several other passages of your numerous discussions \\n\\nwith person number 12, some relate -- relate to what -- to some of the excuses that you \\n\\nhave given or explanations, however you wish to put it, to the Prosecution when you \\n\\nwere interviewed in October 2021.     \\n\\nSo with that, let me start by directing your attention to tab 17, which is binder number \\n\\n2, and -- do you have it?    It\\'s in binder number 2, tab 17. \\n\\nA.      [15:22:24] Yes, your Honour, I\\'m in number 17. \\n\\nQ.      [15:22:27] Okay.    Thank you.    And this sort of -- by way of an explanation, \\n\\nrelates to paragraph 59 to your -- this is primarily for the Court\\'s benefit, but for yours \\n\\nas well to paragraph 59 of your statement of 2021, which was in tab 45.     \\n\\nSo I\\'m not suggesting we do cross-referencing now, but just for future purposes.    If I \\n\\ncould direct your attention to page 11, page 11 of this document, which is \\n\\nKEN-OTP-0157-4131.    If I can direct your attention to line 343, you say:   \\n\\n\"I think you have heard the way I am being mistreated.\"     \\n\\nThen you say that they told you that you were leaving tomorrow and so on. \\n\\nBut here, you see, you claim that you are being mistreated.    Were you lying when \\n\\nyou said that, that you were being mistreated or were you -- is that how you felt?   \\n\\nThat you were being mistreated? \\n\\nA.      [15:23:55] It wasn\\'t mistreated, your Honour, it was misunderstanding.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:23:59] Okay.    So it was -- when you say \"misunderstanding\", \\n\\n25.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 101   \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-057-Red-ENG WT 25-02-2022 102/120 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                              (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS:    KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nmisunderstanding between you and VWU? \\n\\nA.      [15:24:06] It was misunderstanding between VWU, protection people and social \\n\\npeople. \\n\\nQ.      [15:24:13] Okay.    They had the misunderstanding, not you? \\n\\nA.      [15:24:16] Not me, they ... just ... \\n\\nQ.      [15:24:20] Okay.    And so their misunderstanding caused you to be mistreated? \\n\\nA.      [15:24:26] No, I wasn\\'t mistreated but ...   \\n\\nQ.      [15:24:29] Okay.    All right.    If we could go to tab 5, tab 5, and that\\'s in binder \\n\\nnumber 1.    And so binder number 1, tab 5.    The date of your conversation is 28 June \\n\\n2004, and -- \\n\\nA.      [15:24:54] You say?   \\n\\nQ.      [15:24:55] It\\'s tab 5, binder 1. \\n\\nA.      [15:25:09] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:25:10] And if we could go to page 3 and that is KEN-OTP-0148-0933, and if I \\n\\ncould -- when you get there, let me know. \\n\\nA.      [15:25:37] Yes, I am in there, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:25:39] Okay.    You\\'re on page 3? \\n\\nA.      [15:25:46] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:25:46] And we\\'ll start with line 68.    This is you: \"After we\\'ve finished, I\\'ll \\n\\nask them to leave me in peace, because I don\\'t want to get into any arguments with \\n\\nthem.\"     \\n\\nAnd then further down, line 73:   \\n\\n\"I\\'ve already assisted them with what they wanted ...\" \\n\\nLine 75: \"... in good faith, but they\" don\\'t \"appreciate and they also\" don\\'t \"want to \\n\\nsettle me ...\"   \\n\\n25.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 102   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-057-Red-ENG WT 25-02-2022 103/120 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                              (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS:    KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nLine 77: \"... they want to send me back home for me to be killed there.

What\\'s that all about?\"     \\n\\nAnd then you say:     \\n\\n\"That\\'s true.    I\\'ll tell them.    I know they\\'ll be shocked ...\" \\n\\nSo here, you\\'re saying, \"Well, you know, I can testify on the other side.\"    It seems like \\n\\nyou\\'re rather flexible on how you\\'re going to testify.    Right?    That what \\n\\nyou\\'re -- that\\'s the impression that you\\'re giving.    That you\\'re willing to testify \\n\\nagainst them whoever them is (Overlapping speakers) \\n\\nA.      [15:27:04] Yes, your Honour, I was just telling him --   \\n\\nQ.      [15:27:05] Right.   \\n\\nA.      [15:27:06] -- but not -- it was not accurate because I was just giving information. \\n\\nQ.      [15:27:10] I understand -- \\n\\nA.      [15:27:12] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [15:27:12] And line 82:   \\n\\n\"I[t]\\'ll cause misunderstanding[s] with the OTP.\"     \\n\\nAnd then you\\'re laughing.     \\n\\nAnd then further down: \"The OTP will\" -- line 84:   \\n\\n\"The OTP will tell them that we told you that the lady is complicated -- what did you \\n\\ndo\" -- \"what did you do to her?\"    Laughing. \\n\\nIt seems everybody was laughing then.

[15:28:10] No, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:28:11] Okay.    Then they say: \\n\\n\"They told me they will take me on holiday until Monday.\"    Right?    So was \\n\\nthat -- was that a lie or was that the truth?    Did they actually tell you they were going \\n\\nto take you on a holiday until Monday? \\n\\nA.      [15:28:31] I don\\'t remember, your Honour.     \\n\\nQ.      [15:28:32] Okay.    Well, if they were -- if they had told you that they would take \\n\\nyou on holiday until Monday, is that a mistreatment of you? \\n\\nA.      [15:28:41] No, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:28:43] Okay.

It was me myself, but I was just \\n\\ntelling them because they already left --   \\n\\nQ.      [15:32:55] Okay --   \\n\\nA.      [15:32:55] -- because if I wanted to leave, I could have -- leave.    Nobody was \\n\\nforcing me to --   \\n\\nQ.      [15:33:02] Okay --   \\n\\nA.      [15:33:02] -- be -- to stay. \\n\\nQ.      [15:33:03] All right.    Now, there came a time when there was a conversation \\n\\nbetween you and number 12 that was brought to the OTP\\'s attention concerning \\n\\na laptop.    Do you recall that? \\n\\nA.      [15:33:16] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\n25.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 106   \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-057-Red-ENG WT 25-02-2022 107/120 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                              (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS:    KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nQ.      [15:33:17] And it seemed that the Prosecutor had read it the way I was reading it \\n\\nand there seemed to be an indication that perhaps there was something untowards \\n\\nconcerning that conversation you were having with person number 12.     \\n\\nSo if you could turn to tab 18, tab 18, binder 2, this is the conversation, 5 July 2004.   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:33:55] \"2014.\" \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:33:58] \"2014.\"    Thank you.

Well, I wasn\\'t going to go that far, but I \\n\\nreally appreciate the intervention and the reminder.    So thank you very much, sir. \\n\\nQ.      [15:34:54] Just this conversation is taking place concerning the laptop, and if you \\n\\ngo to 286, you say:   \\n\\nI will come to get my -- my son a laptop then.     \\n\\nAnd then there, person number 12 indicates that\\'s it\\'s around, it\\'s 150.     \\n\\nI take it, 150 euro, is that what we\\'re talking about when he says \"150\"? \\n\\nA.

Right.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:35:59] Concerning the issue of the laptop, it seems that you were planning \\n\\non having the laptop fixed - or whatever - for one price and yet -- and then claim \\n\\na larger amount.     \\n\\nWas that -- was that the discussion? \\n\\nA.      [15:36:21] That was the discussion, but he was asking me to do that.    But for me, \\n\\nI never did it and he took me to -- to where we can maintain -- we can -- they do the \\n\\nlaptops.    And I didn\\'t trust it and I took the laptop to MediaMarkt and it was \\n\\nresetted and that was it.     \\n\\nQ.      [15:36:49] Okay.    All right.    Well, I\\'m in my last binder, just -- so hopefully \\n\\nwe\\'ll -- I\\'ll be finished shortly.    I don\\'t know.    Hopefully. \\n\\nOkay, if I could take you to tab 45, which is in binder 2, and, this is, I just wanted to \\n\\nmake reference to -- again, this is where you say, if we go to page 12 of this document \\n\\nand that\\'s KEN-OTP-0160-0620, this is from your conversation with the Prosecution \\n\\non 4 October 2021.    And here, you\\'re saying that person number 12 told you that he \\n\\nneeded you to jump out of the ICC and that he would give you a lawyer. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:38:14] Which paragraph are you referring to?   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:38:17] Paragraph 64.

[15:38:21] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:38:25] And the whole idea was for you to seek asylum? \\n\\nA.      [15:38:29] According to them, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:38:31] Well, there were discussions that you were having -- okay? \\n\\nA.      [15:38:37] I had a discussion, your Honour, yes, but I didn\\'t mean it because I \\n\\nknew -- I wouldn\\'t do -- I wouldn\\'t do that. \\n\\nQ.      [15:38:45] Okay.    Well, with the discussion -- that person had gone to a lawyer, \\n\\nright? \\n\\nA.      [15:38:56] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:38:59] And he was in the process of getting asylum or seeking asylum? \\n\\nA.      [15:39:03] That is what they wanted me to do. \\n\\nQ.      [15:39:05] Well, is that what he was doing? \\n\\nA.      [15:39:08] They were doing that, so that they (Overlapping speakers)   \\n\\nQ.      [15:39:11] They were doing that.    And they offered to help you with that? \\n\\nA.      [15:39:16] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:39:17] And you said that you were in agreement to that, that you were -- at \\n\\nleast you were going along with that, whether you intended to or not is a different \\n\\nstory, but at least you gave them the impression that you were interested in going in \\n\\nthat route? \\n\\nA.      [15:39:32] And then I just left them. \\n\\nQ.      [15:39:36] You gave them the impression that you also wanted to seek asylum.   \\n\\nA.      [15:39:41] Because they were already in asylum, so I had to talk like them so that \\n\\nI can know what actually -- what was going on. \\n\\nQ.      [15:39:49] Why did you need to know what was going on?    I mean --   \\n\\nA.

[15:40:03] So they were evil people? \\n\\nA.      [15:40:06] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:40:08] Okay.    If I could -- if you could look at tab 6, tab 6.   \\n\\nA.      [15:40:14] The same binder? \\n\\nQ.      [15:40:16] Binder number 1.    This is a conversation that took place on 7 July and \\n\\nif I could direct you to page  -- to binder -- tab -- tab 6, and I would like you to refer to \\n\\nline 20, and it\\'s KEN-OTP-0155-5313, and if you\\'re there, let me know. \\n\\nA.      [15:41:07] I\\'m here, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:41:08] And if you could get to -- go to line 656, you say:   \\n\\n\"It would be better if the children were here; who will she leave them with?\"     \\n\\nAnd then he says: \"Yes.    They\\'ll [have] come by that time.\"     \\n\\nAnd you say: \"Yes.\"     \\n\\nOkay.    Then further down, 662:    \"OK. If I get the papers, it\\'ll    be easy.    I\\'ll just \\n\\nmeet your contact person and leave these ones.\" \\n\\nNow, there are other discussions, but let me just see if I can -- you know, if we can \\n\\nresolve this issue.     \\n\\nYou at least were telling these people, whether you intended to or not is something \\n\\nelse - only God knows what you intended because we can\\'t read your mind - but you \\n\\nwere trying to let them believe that you wanted -- you wanted to seek asylum as well, \\n\\nright? \\n\\nA.

[15:42:41]    Now once you had your papers, you would be able to bring your \\n\\nchildren here and then you would say, \"OTP, bye-bye.\"      Basically that\\'s what you \\n\\nwere telling them, were you not? \\n\\nA.      [15:42:52] That is what I was telling them, but they know very well it\\'s not \\n\\npossible like that. \\n\\nQ.      [15:42:58] Okay.   \\n\\nA.      [15:42:59] They knew it themselves.    It\\'s not possible like that, so I was just \\n\\nsaying for the sake. \\n\\nQ.      [15:43:04] All right.    Well, let me -- I will quickly -- with the Court\\'s indulgence, \\n\\nI would like to just take a minute to go through and see whether I need to hit this any \\n\\nharder or whether I\\'ll just leave it at that, but I think the point is more or less made. \\n\\n(Pause in proceedings)   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS: [15:44:48] \\n\\nQ.

[15:44:03] -- that were you to get your papers, that is, for asylum, that you were \\n\\ngoing to leave the ICC.    You had no more -- you had no further use of them.   \\n\\nBasically, that\\'s what you were telling them.   \\n\\nA.      [15:44:17] No, your Honour.    It doesn\\'t mean like that.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:44:24] I -- okay, I\\'d just put my binder away, but it\\'s right here, I have it, I \\n\\ncan go through all of these.    So let me ask you the question again, did you or did you \\n\\nnot communicate to them on the phone - when you were being listened into without \\n\\nyou knowing - that once you got your papers, you were going to leave the ICC?   \\n\\nLeave the OTP?    Isn\\'t that what you told them? \\n\\nA.      [15:44:48] I told them, your Honour, but I never leaved.     \\n\\nQ.      [15:44:54] I know you never left, but that\\'s what you told them.   \\n\\nA.      [15:44:57] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:44:58] And you told them when you thought nobody was listening into you, \\n\\nother than the gentleman that -- with whom you were speaking? \\n\\nA.      [15:45:06] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:45:07] Okay.    Now a couple of quick points, if we could go to tab 11, binder \\n\\n1.   \\n\\nA.      [15:45:30] In there, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.

[15:46:45] I say that, your Honour, but he was there when during post-election \\n\\nviolence and I was there and all of us, we witness what was happening.    So for him \\n\\nasking me that, that I had to say that. \\n\\nQ.      [15:46:59] Really? \\n\\nA.      [15:47:00] Because it was -- everybody saw what happened, Your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:47:03] Mm. \\n\\nA.      [15:47:04] So he was there and he\\'s asking me and he knows what happened. \\n\\nQ.      [15:47:10] You\\'re saying here, \"I didn\\'t witness a lot that happened really.\"    And \\n\\nit seems that you\\'re saying, I don\\'t even know why I\\'m in this case, because later on \\n\\nyou\\'re saying you (Overlapping speakers)   \\n\\nA.

[15:53:14] Can you repeat the question. \\n\\nQ.      [15:53:15] Okay.    When you first came to testify, you projected a certain aura, \\n\\na certain image, the first day, and --   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:53:30] Mr Karnavas, you mean here or?   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:53:32] Here, the first day here -- \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:53:33] Okay. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:53:34]   \\n\\nQ.      [15:53:34] -- when you testified, when Mr Steynberg was questioning you, and \\n\\nnow I\\'m asking -- now that we\\'ve heard -- not just your answers to questions, but also \\n\\nwe\\'ve heard your own words -- or you have heard your own words during   \\n\\nconversations you had when you did not know you were being tape-recorded -- \\n\\nA.      [15:53:56] But I -- \\n\\nQ.      [15:53:57] -- what would you -- allow me the courtesy.

[15:54:15] Your Honour (Overlapping speakers) \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [15:54:18] Your Honour, I\\'m going to object to that question.   \\n\\nWhat image was the witness trying to project?    That\\'s not been established.    It\\'s not \\n\\na fact on the record.    That\\'s my learned friend\\'s editorialisation and his assumption, \\n\\nbut it seems to me that\\'s an entirely improper question. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:54:33] Well, if I may -- if I may, very briefly, I know it\\'s getting \\n\\nclose.    One of the -- one of the aspects of a trial and one of the aspects of assessing the \\n\\nevidence is for the judge to assess the demeanour of the witness, or to factor that in as \\n\\npart of assessing the evidence, the demeanour of the witness.    So whether I use the \\n\\nword \"image\" or \"demeanour\", it is the same thing.     \\n\\nSo I think it\\'s a perfectly fine question to ask.    She came in with one demeanour on \\n\\ndirect examination when she -- after being proofed by the Prosecution for several \\n\\ndays, and now we have heard her words and I just simply want to know whether \\n\\nthose words that we -- whether we should have the same impression of her after \\n\\nhearing those words in comparison to the impression that she was trying to give \\n\\nthrough her direct examination when she first appeared.    That\\'s the question.    If \\n\\nshe\\'s able to answer it. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:55:49] All right, couch the question for the witness \\n\\nto hear --   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:55:53] Okay.   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:55:54] -- and answer, please.     \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:55:54] All right.    I thought it would be a lot easier.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:55:58] But let me put it to you this way, when you first came and you gave \\n\\nyour evidence, when you were being questioned by the Prosecutor, you projected \\n\\n25.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 117   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-057-Red-ENG WT 25-02-2022 118/120 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                              (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS:    KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\na certain image for the Court? \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:56:11] Which image was that? \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:56:13] The image that she was trying to project, whatever \\n\\nimage we all received.    I got one, you got -- you know, whatever we all perceived. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [15:56:21] I\\'m sorry, your Honour, to interject again.    My learned \\n\\nfriend summarised it quite correctly when he said that demeanour is a matter for the \\n\\njudge to assess --   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:56:31] I\\'ll rephrase.   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:      [15:56:32] -- for your Honour to assess.   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:56:33] I\\'ll rephrase.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:56:34] Considering -- considering what we\\'ve heard from your own words, \\n\\nthe way you describe the OTP, the way you describe the VWU, the excuses that you \\n\\ngave as to why you were saying what you were saying, do you still maintain that you \\n\\nare a truthful person and everybody else that has testified differently than you is \\n\\nlying? \\n\\nA.      [15:57:05] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:57:07] Thank you.    I have no further questions. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:57:14] Thank you very much, Mr Karnavas.     \\n\\nMr Steynberg, any re-examination, if any, please.     \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [15:57:25] Your Honour, I do have some significant questions to \\n\\nask this witness, and, unfortunately, I will not be able to do it in three minutes, so ...   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:57:32] Can you -- maybe if you advise the Court \\n\\nhow long would you --   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [15:57:36] Certainly within one session.

Now a vignette, as your Honour will no doubt know, is \\n\\na small portrait with no background, but unfortunately the background is sometimes \\n\\nimportant in order to properly appreciate the facts.     \\n\\nSo with your Honour\\'s leave, I need to pull together the various facts to illustrate that \\n\\nbackground, to put to the witness certain portions that were omitted by my learned \\n\\nfriend in his cross-examination, and, that will, I think it will take me somewhat less \\n\\nthan one session on Monday morning, with your Honour\\'s leave. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:58:43] And if I may be heard, your Honour?   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:58:46] Yes, Mr Karnavas. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:58:50] And depending on what contexts are these vignettes \\n\\nwe -- we hear from the Prosecution, I may -- I may, I\\'m not saying that I will, but I \\n\\nmay be asking leave -- seeking leave for re-cross-examination.      I know that some \\n\\njudges don\\'t allow that; I appreciate that but depending on what we hear on Monday, \\n\\nI may be seeking leave - and I only put that out there as a cautionary measure for the \\n\\nProsecution to know that - that I might -- that I might be seeking time to rebut his \\n\\nrebuttal. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:59:24] Well, as we all know as lawyers, we know \\n\\nthat, you know, for re-examination, I expect that what Mr Steynberg will be putting \\n\\nacross to the witness will be new facts that you may have raised, and, you know, so \\n\\nyou may not have to do a re- re-examination, you know.     \\n\\nSo having said that, Mr Steynberg, if that\\'s your position that you come on Monday, \\n\\n25.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 119   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-057-Red-ENG WT 25-02-2022 120/120 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                              (Open Session)                                                      ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS:    KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\nwe\\'ll do that.     \\n\\nAnd Madam Witness, you have -- today\\'s Friday -- \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [15:59:50] Yes, your Honour.   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:59:55] You have quite a few days, it\\'s not like \\n\\nyesterday coming here today.

[9:40:04] Well, I wasn\\'t privy to that, so let me just -- this is not a trick question.   \\n\\nSo let me just ask it as plainly as I can. \\n\\nAccording to the information provided to us, it states that:    \"In 2004, started \\n\\na community-based organisation\" - It has the name.    And if you look at the \\n\\ndocument, it tells the name - \"in [location 28], and was a chairperson until \\n\\nMarch 2011.\" \\n\\nSo is this correct or incorrect? \\n\\nA.      [9:40:46] Incorrect.   \\n\\nQ.      [9:40:48] All right.    But you were, were you not, doing NGO work up until that \\n\\ntime?   \\n\\nA.      [9:41:03] No, I had another job.   \\n\\nQ.

And, in fact, you were rather rich from those projects.   \\n\\nA.      [9:41:29] Not rich, but I was doing -- I was working, but I was given something \\n\\nmore sustainable for me to keep on --   \\n\\nQ.      [9:41:41] Just -- just sustainable, or were you rich? \\n\\nA.      [9:41:46] I was not rich. \\n\\nQ.      [9:41:47] Okay.   \\n\\nA.

[9:47:39] These are the transcripts of your conversations that you were having \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 8 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 9/119 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nwith person number 2 -- number 12 when you were not aware that you were \\n\\nbeing -- that he -- that at least he was being recorded based on a request from \\n\\nthe Prosecution.    You\\'re aware of that, aren\\'t you?   \\n\\nA.      [9:48:03] I\\'m not aware.   \\n\\nQ.      [9:48:04] You\\'re not aware.    Okay.    We\\'ll get to that.     \\n\\nBut anyway, for the record, if Madam -- if your Honour can see this, this is 1,450 \\n\\npages or so of transcript from conversations.    I will not -- I promise you, \\n\\nyour Honour, I will not go through all of these during this session with this witness, \\n\\nbut just -- let\\'s just say, the cream of the cream.   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [9:48:35] Your Honour, may I just have some clarifications \\n\\nbecause that seems to be completely out of tally with what my expectation would be.   \\n\\nAre these the transcripts of the recordings of person 12\\'s phone calls or only those \\n\\ninvolving this witness? \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [9:48:56] He\\'s absolutely right.    They\\'re only involving this \\n\\nwitness.    These are the ones that you -- that you provided us, and these are with this \\n\\nwitness and, sorry to say I, had to go through almost 1,500 pages of documents, but -- \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:49:17] Mr Karnavas, go on.

[9:50:04] Okay.    Now, you said that, right? \\n\\nA.      [9:50:05] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:50:06] Okay.    So this was in reference to your children, right? \\n\\nA.      [9:50:09] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:50:10] And are you suggesting -- are you saying that at some point back then \\n\\nwhen you were -- this would be before 2011 -- you had the children in -- in boarding \\n\\nschools?     \\n\\nA.      [9:50:17] I had my children before even I joined ICC in boarding school. \\n\\nQ.      [9:50:37] Okay.    All right.    And I suspect that that\\'s pretty expensive.   \\n\\nA.      [9:50:41] It wasn\\'t that much expensive.   \\n\\nQ.      [9:50:43] Okay.    But once you got into the ICC programme, the ICC was paying \\n\\nfor the children\\'s education, including the boarding schools that you were demanding \\n\\nthat they be educated in, right?   \\n\\nA.      [9:50:56] No, your Honour.    I was not demanding.    But because of security \\n\\nreason, after entering to ICC, I had to remove, because one of the time, my son was \\n\\nvisited by someone who is not in the list.    And that is why I say they should move.   \\n\\nQ.      [9:51:18] Okay.    And we\\'re going to get to this at some point, but just a point of \\n\\nclarification.    You only have one -- one -- one son.   \\n\\nA.      [9:51:32] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:51:33] And yet, from the very outset, you\\'ve always represented that you had \\n\\nthree children.   \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 10 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 11/119 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nA.      [9:51:41] Yes, your Honour.    The reason is, in our culture, we always put as \\n\\nyour children, your brother is your children.    Ask your -- Mr Gicheru, he knows that. \\n\\nQ.      [9:51:56] And the more children you have, the more money they have to provide \\n\\nyou if they are providing you with security, right? \\n\\nA.      [9:52:03] No, your Honour.    Because these are the children I had when they met \\n\\nme.    It\\'s not that I brought them when I met them.   \\n\\nQ.      [9:52:11] You represented to the Court under oath that you had adopted \\n\\nthe children.    Do you recall that? \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [9:52:20] Can we have a reference, please. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:52:23] I think adopted is a legal -- it\\'s a legal term.   \\n\\nI don\\'t -- anyway, let the witness -- I mean, if you can maybe explain to the witness \\n\\nand she should be in a position to answer.    She understands adoption.    Not cultural \\n\\nbut adoption as a legal term. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [9:52:42] I wasn\\'t going to go into it too much.    I just wanted to \\n\\ngive the witness an opportunity to -- to -- to tell us. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:52:51] Because if I remember, what -- the word she \\n\\nused there was \"guardian\". \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [9:52:56] I understand, your Honour.    I totally understand.   \\n\\nQ.      [9:53:01] Do you recall being questioned in the Ruto and Sang case?   \\n\\nA.      [9:53:04] Yes, your Honour, I remember. \\n\\nQ.      [9:53:07] And do you remember the issue of those children coming into question, \\n\\nas to whether they were yours or whether you had adopted them, in the legal sense? \\n\\nA.      [9:53:22] What I understood by that time was I adopted, but it\\'s just a word of \\n\\nusing it so I can -- I was having the children for a long time, but I didn\\'t adopt exactly \\n\\nbecause I was away.    When all these things started, I had to leave.    And my sister \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 11 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 12/119 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nwas sick, and no one was providing my children.    And so that is the reason why I \\n\\nwasn\\'t able.     \\n\\nAnd the time when my sister went to court, wanted to -- to represent and sign \\n\\naffidavit to say I had children, the court in Kenya demanded me to go back and sign, \\n\\nbut I wasn\\'t able to go because of the situation I was in.    That was the reason \\n\\nI didn\\'t -- we didn\\'t sign it.    But I was a guardian.    That\\'s how it was.   \\n\\nQ.      [9:54:29] So do you recall having any conversations with person number 12 \\n\\nregarding your children, these children, and the adoption problems that you were \\n\\nhaving?    If you recall.   \\n\\nA.      [9:54:45] Yeah, I had a conversation with number 12.   \\n\\nQ.      [9:54:48] Okay.   \\n\\nA.      [9:54:49] And number 12 was -- he wanted me to leave the protection and join \\n\\nhim.    And it was hard for me.    And he was asking me that he could look for \\n\\na lawyer, and then the children will come after three months.   \\n\\nQ.      [9:55:10] Okay.    We\\'re going to get to the adoption and the children later on.    I \\n\\njust wanted to get that on the record for now.    So let me move on to the next topic. \\n\\nAs I understand it, it was sometime around May 2011 when you went into protection \\n\\nby an organisation in location, I think it\\'s number 13, where the organisation is \\n\\norganised by -- do you recall that?    Were you in protection in -- as of -- as of \\n\\nMay 2011 by organisation number 13?   \\n\\nA.      [9:56:09] Yes, your Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [9:56:10] Right.    And that was for six months, was it not? \\n\\nA.      [9:56:15] It was, your Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [9:56:16] And so if we count from May 2011, we count six months, we\\'re talking \\n\\nOctober, November, pushing it all the way maybe to December 2011, right?   \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 12 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 13/119 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nA.      [9:56:32] Yes, your Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [9:56:33] And after -- when the six months expired, were you still in protection?   \\n\\nA.      [9:56:45] No, your Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [9:56:47] Okay.    Thank you.    Now, before we -- as I understand it, your first \\n\\ncontact with the Prosecution was about a year later in December 2012.    That was \\n\\nyour first contact.   \\n\\nA.      [9:57:17] I don\\'t remember the date, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:57:19] Okay.    We\\'ll get to that. \\n\\nNow, before we talk about your first contact and what happened thereafter, a couple \\n\\nof housekeeping matters, since we\\'re talking about your background.    Did you have \\n\\na national identification card at that time? \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:57:42] At what time, Mr Karnavas?   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:     \\n\\nQ.      [9:57:44] At 2011, 2012, did you have a national identification card?   \\n\\nA.      [9:57:50] Yes, I had, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:57:52] Did you have a passport?   \\n\\nA.      [9:57:57] No, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:57:58] Okay.    What about, were you enrolled in the national social security \\n\\nfund?   \\n\\nA.      [9:58:09] I don\\'t remember that.   \\n\\nQ.      [9:58:10] Okay.    What about the national hospital insurance fund?    You had \\n\\nchildren, you know, maybe that might help you remember.   \\n\\nA.      [9:58:25] I remember when I was pregnant with my son, I used to pay, because \\n\\nwhen -- after the birth, I didn\\'t bother to ...   \\n\\nQ.      [9:58:41] Okay, all right.

[9:59:25] And during that period up until, say, 2011, did you ever visit any \\n\\npublic offices or -- public offices, where you have to go into the building and show \\n\\nidentification?   \\n\\nA.

[10:02:57] Yes, you heard on the transcript, your Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:03:01] We\\'re going to get a lot further and quicker if you just answer my \\n\\nquestions.    This is what you were told?   \\n\\nA.      [10:03:08] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:03:09] And you just told us you never met him, did not know him, right?   \\n\\nA.      [10:03:14] Yeah, I used to hear only he\\'s a lawyer in town.    Like -- like you hear \\n\\nminister so-and-so, but you haven\\'t met him.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:03:22] All right.    And -- and so when someone told you that they were \\n\\nlooking to find -- to get your photograph and that they would actually get paid \\n\\n2 million Kenyan shillings, you believed that?   \\n\\nA.      [10:03:49] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [10:03:49] All right.    And it didn\\'t dawn on you to say, \"Wait a second.    My \\n\\nphotograph already exists on my -- on my national identification card\"?    That never \\n\\ndawned on you?   \\n\\nA.      [10:04:14] I was scared because I had already have some issues with security.   \\n\\nSo when he mentioned that, made me also be scared, saying, why?   \\n\\nQ.      [10:04:24] So you just believed it? \\n\\nA.      [10:04:26] Yeah, because I was having issues also, you know, before. \\n\\nQ.      [10:04:29] All right.    I -- I\\'m not disputing that.    What I\\'m trying to establish is, \\n\\nwhatever you were being told, you took it at face value.    You just believed it.   \\n\\nA.

You believed him. \\n\\nWell, yesterday, yesterday you mentioned a lot of names, and a lot of names were \\n\\nmentioned by the Prosecution, Mr Steynberg, and all those names came in the context \\n\\nof you telling us what they told you.   \\n\\nA.      [10:05:40] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:05:40] And a lot of times what they were telling you is what others had told \\n\\nthem, right?   \\n\\nA.      [10:05:48] I don\\'t know.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:05:49] Well, from the conversations, you\\'re saying somebody is saying to \\n\\nsomebody who is then telling it to you.

So it wasn\\'t like from other people.    It was from that person \\n\\nparticular saying that he had a meeting. \\n\\nQ.      [10:06:15] Okay.

[10:17:56] And yesterday there was - just as an aside - there was this exchange \\n\\nwhere you had indicated -- or the Prosecution, Mr Steynberg, had confronted you \\n\\nwith what person number 30 had said concerning a meeting he had with you and \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 23 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 24/119 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nwhat had transpired during that meeting.

And to put some \\n\\ncontext into this, this is from an interview where you gave a statement over a period \\n\\nof, it appears, days, several days, several hours in 2021, starting in April -- or in \\n\\nOctober -- October 2021. \\n\\nDo you recall coming to The Hague in 2021 and speaking with Mr Steynberg and his \\n\\nmany associates who were there?   \\n\\nA.

[10:21:28] I\\'m not sure if it was an interview or it was a --   \\n\\nQ.      [10:21:33] Was he grilling you?    Was he interrogating you? \\n\\nA.      [10:21:37] No, no, interrogation. \\n\\nQ.      [10:21:38] He looks like a pretty easygoing guy.     \\n\\nHe was asking you questions, right? \\n\\nA.      [10:21:44] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:21:45] And you were answering those questions, to the best of your ability, \\n\\nright? \\n\\nA.      [10:21:50] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:21:51] And that\\'s when you discovered also that they had been monitoring \\n\\nyour conversations with person number, I think it was 12, right?    That\\'s when you \\n\\nwere -- you first learned of that, right?   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:22:05] Check -- check who person number 12 is, \\n\\nplease, Madam Witness. \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [10:22:25] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:22:27] \\n\\nQ.      [10:22:28] Okay.    So -- and during that period, when you were here being asked \\n\\nquestions and answering those questions, Mr Steynberg or his associate -- because we \\n\\ndon\\'t have a verbatim transcript, so we don\\'t really know what happened during all \\n\\nthose days.

That is the way they present it.     \\n\\nOne of the topics during that conversation was -- they asked you about what \\n\\nso-and-so might have said about you and to give you an opportunity to affirm it or \\n\\nnegate it, to say \"yes\" or \"no\", to clarify.    Do you recall that?   \\n\\nA.      [10:23:23] I don\\'t recall, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:23:24] All right.    If you look at paragraph 24 -- do you have it?   \\n\\nA.      [10:23:35] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:23:36] Okay.    Now, if you would like to read it so we could -- you know, \\n\\nread it to yourself.    I\\'m trying to keep from going in and out of public session.    If \\n\\nyou could read it.    Take a moment.    And when you\\'ve read it, let me know. \\n\\nDo you see that?   \\n\\nA.      [10:24:06] I can see that, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:24:08] And do you see where you correct Mr Steynberg, that this meeting \\n\\nactually did not take place in a hotel but, rather, it took place in a restaurant?   \\n\\nA.      [10:24:25] Your Honour, we use that word in -- you know, here -- in here, it\\'s \\n\\ndifferent from -- if you go even in a village restaurant, people call hotel.    So it\\'s \\n\\na kind of -- if you say hotel, it\\'s generalising everything.    It doesn\\'t mean like to be \\n\\nspecific. \\n\\nQ.      [10:24:55] Okay.    But my point is -- and maybe I\\'m being hyper-technical here, \\n\\nso forgive me.    The conversation took place in a restaurant, that\\'s what you\\'re telling \\n\\nMr Steynberg, right? \\n\\nA.      [10:25:10] Yeah. \\n\\nQ.      [10:25:10] And it was a public restaurant.   \\n\\nA.      [10:25:12] Yeah. \\n\\nQ.      [10:25:12] It wasn\\'t some private room.    It was in a public area.   \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 26 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 27/119 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nA.

So I won\\'t belabour \\n\\nthe point anymore.     \\n\\nThank you.    Thank you very much. \\n\\nAnd, of course -- person number 12, of course, we know that you had several hours.   \\n\\nI have the exact number of hours.    I\\'ll get it to you later on.    You knew him quite \\n\\nwell also, person number 12, before -- before 2012, when you met with \\n\\nthe Prosecution, you knew him, did you not?   \\n\\nA.      [10:26:00] I knew him because we -- we reside from the same location. \\n\\nQ.      [10:26:06] And, of course, person number 63 -- person number 63, if you could \\n\\nbe so kind as to look at person number 63.    You knew him as well.   \\n\\nA.      [10:26:30] Yeah, I met him one time when we had a meeting.    That\\'s how I \\n\\ncame to know him.    But not that much.    Since that time, we have been talking in \\n\\na phone. \\n\\nQ.      [10:26:46] You knew him.    You knew him, did you not?   \\n\\nA.      [10:26:50] I knew him.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:26:51] And, in fact, he came to visit you once.    You don\\'t recall that? \\n\\nA.      [10:27:00] I don\\'t recall that.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:27:02] Don\\'t you recall when he came to visit you when you were in \\n\\nthe hospital?   \\n\\nA.      [10:27:08] Oh, yes.    Yes, your Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:27:11] Okay.   \\n\\nA.      [10:27:12] Thank you for reminding me.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:27:14] All right.

[10:27:22] No, your Honour.    He wanted me to go back to Kenya. \\n\\nQ.      [10:27:25] Okay.    But he didn\\'t -- he didn\\'t ask about your health.   \\n\\nA.      [10:27:30] No.    He was coming to check if I was well and then we go. \\n\\nQ.      [10:27:34] Okay.    All right.    So -- you know, I had a list of questions to pose to \\n\\nyou, but it seems that you\\'ve answered every one of them on your own about not \\n\\nknowing Mr Gicheru, never having called him, never having talked to him, never \\n\\nhaving met him.    So you saved us a lot of time on that.     \\n\\nBut concerning that topic, you said that you knew him as a lawyer.    Were you also \\n\\naware of the -- or did there come across to you at some point that he had represented \\n\\nsomeone who had withdrawn as a witness for the Prosecution?    It made the news.   \\n\\nIt was in the newspapers.    Did you know that?    Had you read about that? \\n\\nA.      [10:28:31] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:28:32] All right.    So you knew exactly who he was at that time?   \\n\\nA.      [10:28:38] Not really.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:28:39] Okay.    All right.    Well, we won\\'t belabour the point. \\n\\nNow let\\'s go to your first meeting with the Prosecution. \\n\\nAnd here, your Honour, I\\'m going to be referring to tab 88, which is in volume 3.   \\n\\nTab 88.

And if we look at the dates at the bottom of this first page, \\n\\nthe first time it was a meeting in December 1, 2012, from 1100 hours to 1800 hours.   \\n\\nBy my calculation, that\\'s seven hours.    And then on the next day, from 11 to \\n\\n1700 hours, that\\'s six hours.

[11:34:45] Yes, your Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:34:46] Okay.    Good. \\n\\nAll right.    Thus far we -- we said that in December 1 and 2 of 2011 - yeah, 2011 - is \\n\\nwhen you first went to the OTP -- 12, I\\'m sorry, 12.    2012, my apologies.    You went \\n\\nto the OTP investigators to provide your first statement; is that right? \\n\\nA.      [11:35:19] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [11:35:20] And we also indicated that, in giving that statement, you gave them \\n\\nsome information.    And based on that information, they had made a determination \\n\\nthat all the information you were providing them was secondhand, and therefore, \\n\\nthey could get that information from the source and you were not needed by them.     \\n\\nWe\\'ve discussed this, right?   \\n\\nA.      [11:35:56] Your Honour, I had explained the reason why. \\n\\nQ.      [11:35:59] I understand.    We\\'re going to get there.    I just want to give \\n\\na summary. \\n\\nAnd then after that, you gave an explanation as to why you only told half the truth on \\n\\nthat occasion, right?   \\n\\nA.      [11:36:13] Yeah, because I (inaudible).   \\n\\nQ.      [11:36:17] Right.

[11:36:57] Your Honour, as --   \\n\\nQ.      [11:36:59] Did we discuss this this morning?    I know we -- I\\'m just doing \\n\\na summary for the public so they know what exactly we discussed.    I\\'m not trying to \\n\\ngo over the same thing.   \\n\\nA.      [11:37:14] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [11:37:14] Okay.    All right. \\n\\nAnd in clarifying matters, you indicated that you had actually gone to a house that is \\n\\nlocated near location number 6.    So if you look at location number 6.    Right?   \\n\\nThat\\'s where that house was, in that -- in that area.    Not -- not at location, but in \\n\\nthe area of location number 6.   \\n\\nA.      [11:37:50] Yes, your Honour.    Not -- not very far from --   \\n\\nQ.      [11:37:54] Not very far from there.    And that\\'s where, now rather than saying \\n\\nyou passed by that house, you actually went, and on two different days you cooked.   \\n\\nRight?    You cooked for the warriors who were getting ready or were in the midst of \\n\\nwaging war.    We discussed that, right?   \\n\\nA.      [11:38:30] Yes, your Honour, with a reason. \\n\\nQ.

That\\'s -- that\\'s what I\\'m trying to \\n\\nsay, your Honour. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [11:40:06] And not the second time --   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [11:40:08] Not the second time. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [11:40:09] -- when she gave the full information. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [11:40:11] No.    And I -- if I --   \\n\\nQ.

You \\n\\ndidn\\'t use the word \"barbecued\", but I mean --   \\n\\nA.      [11:41:46] I know what you mean, your Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:41:49] Yeah.    That\\'s how he was punished, right, your neighbour?    They \\n\\ntook his cow away, and they slaughtered it for the feast, right? \\n\\nA.      [11:41:57] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.

All right. \\n\\nNow just as a matter of technicality, because, you know, times change, are you \\n\\nsuggesting that at that time -- 2011, 2012, 2013 -- the national identification card that \\n\\none carried in -- in Kenya had maybe the name, place of birth, height, weight and \\n\\nwhat have you, description, but no photograph; is that what you\\'re saying?    That \\n\\nmaybe this is sort of a new invention.    They came up with a new version of \\n\\nthe identification card. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [11:43:52] Madam Witness, the ID card that you had \\n\\nat that period is what counsel is referring to.

But do they take your photograph? \\n\\nA.      [11:44:25] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [11:44:26] Okay.    Usually, it\\'s almost like an instant photograph these days.   \\n\\nAnd you also told us that they would take your photograph for your voter \\n\\nregistration.

You\\'re not suggesting that the national security services could \\n\\nnot have located a photograph of you without having to have a lawyer ask someone \\n\\nto ask another person to get to you to photograph you.   \\n\\nA.      [11:45:28] Your Honour, can I explain?   \\n\\nQ.      [11:45:31] Well, I\\'m just -- can you answer my question first and then give \\n\\nthe explanation.     \\n\\nYou\\'re not suggesting that -- let me put it this way:    We\\'ve heard testimony here and \\n\\nwith other witnesses that the national security services were capable of listening in on \\n\\npeople\\'s phones and even tracking them.    Was that your experience as well or your \\n\\nfear, that they could listen into your phone and track you where you were, even if \\n\\nyou were outside of Kenya?   \\n\\nA.      [11:46:05] I don\\'t know, your Honour, what were the plan, because I wasn\\'t in \\n\\nthe meeting with them.    So I\\'ve no idea. \\n\\nQ.      [11:46:11] Ma\\'am, I\\'m not asking you about a plan, and I\\'m not asking you about \\n\\na meeting.    I\\'m asking you, were you in fear that the national security services of \\n\\nKenya had the capabilities of listening into your phone?    It\\'s a yes, or it\\'s a no.   \\n\\nA.      [11:46:36] In fact, I was told they were listening, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [11:46:38] Okay.    So they were able to -- you were told of this.    Did you believe \\n\\nit? \\n\\nA.      [11:46:42] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [11:46:43] You believed that they were able to listen in on your phone \\n\\nconversations? \\n\\nA.

[11:46:48] And maybe even track you? \\n\\nA.      [11:46:50] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [11:46:51] So would a security service that had those capabilities, would they be \\n\\nso inept that they would not know to go to the national bureau where they keep all \\n\\nthese statistics, including your photograph on your identification card, voter \\n\\nregistration and what have you, that they would have to send somebody and actually \\n\\noffer a 2 million-dollar -- a 2 million shilling bribe to get a photograph of you?   \\n\\nA.      [11:47:21] Your Honour, it\\'s not like not in -- intelligent.    There is hitmen also \\n\\nwhich is -- doesn\\'t have your photo.    It doesn\\'t mean like it is only national security.     \\n\\nQ.      [11:47:37] Okay.   \\n\\nA.      [11:47:39] There is hitmen.    Like number -- person number 43, we don\\'t know \\n\\nwhat happened.       \\n\\nQ.      [11:47:46] Well, we don\\'t know -- you\\'re not suggesting that he was a hitman.   \\n\\nA.      [11:47:50] I\\'m not saying, but is no more.    And what happened, we don\\'t know.   \\n\\nSo something like that can happen, and we don\\'t know exactly who did that.   \\n\\nSo something like that might happen, what was, you know (Overlapping speakers).   \\n\\nQ.      [11:48:09] But that\\'s --   \\n\\nA.      [11:48:09] That\\'s the reason.    It\\'s not a must to be national security. \\n\\nQ.      [11:48:08] Ma\\'am --   \\n\\nA.      [11:48:09] No, no.    I\\'m saying it\\'s not a must.    If someone asks, he knows better \\n\\nthe idea why he was asking.    But it was only my opinion to say, they beat national \\n\\nsecurity, or he knows better. \\n\\nQ.      [11:48:24] Ma\\'am, I\\'m just saying -- I\\'m just going by your transcript.

[14:34:45] Yeah, you say 73. \\n\\nQ.      [14:34:49] Yeah.    All right.    I mean 78.    I\\'m sorry, 78.    Volume 3, 78, tab 78.   \\n\\nAnd on page 1, when you locate it, you\\'ll see that this is an interview of you that was \\n\\nmentioned by Mr Steynberg and it\\'s April 7, 2003.    It\\'s one of those short interviews.   \\n\\nIt\\'s only an hour and a half.    Do you have it? \\n\\nA.      [14:35:26] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [14:35:27] Okay.    Good.    Good.    Good.     \\n\\nNow if you could be so kind as to turn to page -- page 3.    This is just a housekeeping \\n\\nissue. \\n\\nIf we look at paragraph 14, it says: \"I have been shown a number of documents by \\n\\nthe investigators ...\" and they list all those.    So they actually -- now this time they\\'re \\n\\nsharing information with you.    Okay?    Right?    Do you recall that meeting?     \\n\\nI know it was a long, long time ago.    But it says here that: \"I have been shown \\n\\na number of documents by the investigators\".    In other words, they showed you \\n\\ndocuments on that particular day.    Do you see that? \\n\\nA.      [14:36:31] It was a document.    Not documents.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:36:34] Okay.    I\\'m just reading this.    So if you want to correct it, that\\'s fine.   \\n\\nSo you\\'re saying that on that particular day you vividly remember, on April 7, 2013 - I \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 85 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 86/119 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nknow that you\\'ve been blessed by God with a good memory - you\\'re saying on that \\n\\nparticular day the investigators have it wrong, they only showed you one document \\n\\nand not all the documents that are listed.   \\n\\nA.      [14:37:07] I don\\'t remember that. \\n\\nQ.      [14:37:09] Okay.    But that\\'s what it says, that you were shown documents.   \\n\\nThat\\'s what this says, right? \\n\\nA.      [14:37:16] Yes.    Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [14:37:20] Okay.    All right.    And there\\'s no trick question.    There\\'s no need to \\n\\nthink where\\'s he going with this question.    These are very simple questions \\n\\nand -- and the sooner you answer them the sooner we can get out of here:   \\n\\n\"I recognise these as reports - plural - \"which I gave to [person number 63] of \\n\\nthe [organisation of -- of 1].\"    Do you see that?   \\n\\nAnd then you say: \"I sent these reports in one parcel to him by post through the bus \\n\\ncompany.\"    Do you see that? \\n\\nA.      [14:38:27] I can see that, your Honour.    But you said which one again --   \\n\\nQ.      [14:38:31] Okay, if we look at -- if we look at paragraph 14 --   \\n\\nA.      [14:38:38] I\\'m talking about the organisation, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [14:38:40] Oh, the organisation, it\\'s number 1.     \\n\\nIt\\'s on page 3 of this document.    If you look at that organisation, number 1, it seems \\n\\nto match the one that\\'s ...   \\n\\nA.      [14:39:02] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [14:39:03] Okay.    So you stand by that, right?   \\n\\nA.      [14:39:06] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [14:39:09] Okay.    Then you go down to page -- to paragraph 15.    You say: \\n\\n\"The author of these reports is ...\" and you give the name of number 8, right?   \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 86 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 87/119 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nA.

Now just to make sure that we\\'re clear and that \\n\\nthe Prosecution is -- is content, the information that you\\'re providing here is -- is not \\n\\nbased on the main case, Ruto and Sang.    This has to do with witness interference? \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [14:41:11] Sorry, can I just ask my learned friend to give me more \\n\\nprecession.    Does he mean all the information he\\'s referred to or is it only \\n\\nthe information in the last paragraph?   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [14:41:22] Mr Karnavas. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [14:41:22] Well, the why I\\'m looking -- the way I\\'m reading it, it \\n\\nappears to be all related to Article 70. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [14:41:32] I wonder whether my learned friend has actually read \\n\\nthe annexes to this statement and what they\\'re about.    Because that might answer his \\n\\nown question. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [14:41:44] The report doesn\\'t talk about annexes.

I\\'m talking about the report itself. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [14:41:51] Your Honour, paragraph 14, there\\'s annex 1, annex 3, \\n\\nannex 4, annex 7. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [14:42:01] In none of those annexes, your Honour, has the witness \\n\\ngiven a statement, and I think Mr Steynberg knows that.    We see it in the July \\n\\nstatement.    That\\'s the first time since the first statement that she gave where they \\n\\nactually give her an opportunity to clarify what she said after she was declared to \\n\\nhave insufficient evidence.    I\\'m not suggesting -- I\\'m not suggesting that she was not \\n\\npassing on other information.    We\\'re talking -- there\\'s a difference between \\n\\nproviding documents that somebody else generated and her passing on information \\n\\nregarding what she heard, observed, in the Ruto and Sang case.    And frankly \\n\\nit\\'s -- it\\'s beside the point.    I think we can move on.    But if -- if the gentleman thinks \\n\\nthat I\\'m being unfair to the witness, he can clarify it. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [14:43:05] Mr Karnavas, let me hear you.    Carry on, \\n\\nplease. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [14:43:11] \\n\\nQ.      [14:43:11] Okay.    If we can go on to tab 47.    Tab 47, 0117-0898.    And that\\'s in \\n\\nbinder number 2.    Binder number 2. \\n\\nDo you have the document, Madam? \\n\\nA.      [14:43:59] Yes, your Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:44:00] Okay.    If you look at paragraph 2, we see that you gave figures of \\n\\n42,500 Kenyan shillings for your child to attend the primary school.    And then 38,838 \\n\\nKenyan shillings for the other two children.    Do you see that?   \\n\\nA.      [14:44:34] I can see, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [14:44:35] And the total was 120,176 Kenyan shillings.    This was money that \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 88 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 89/119 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nwas provided to you by the OTP or by the victims unit?   \\n\\nA.      [14:44:57] I don\\'t know, your Honour, which -- who was who. \\n\\nQ.      [14:45:01] All right.    But nonetheless, while you were in -- in their care, if we \\n\\ncould put it that way, they were providing you with funding for a variety of things, \\n\\nincluding education, you know, school, school tuition? \\n\\nA.      [14:45:26] But that time, your Honour, I was away from home and the children \\n\\nwere ...   \\n\\nQ.      [14:45:32] I understand.    I\\'m not -- I\\'m not suggesting anything wrong with that.   \\n\\nBut I just want to make sure that they\\'re providing what would appear to be \\n\\nsomewhat substantial amounts of money for what would also appear to be private \\n\\neducation.     \\n\\nNow I don\\'t know, but is that the case?   \\n\\nA.      [14:45:56] Your Honour, even when I was in Kenya, my children was in private \\n\\neducation.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:46:03] So is the answer to my question, yes, they\\'re providing you funds for \\n\\nprivate education of your children?    Is that the answer to my question?   \\n\\nA.      [14:46:15] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [14:46:15] Okay.    Now just to be clear, because I don\\'t know how -- how tuition \\n\\nis paid, was this for a whole year or was it for part of the year, this amount?   \\n\\nA.      [14:46:33] I can\\'t remember, my Honour, because I was away.    I wasn\\'t the one \\n\\nwho was receiving fees for the children.    There was someone who was receiving fees \\n\\nand handed over the receipt to the OTP, or you say VWU.    So I was away, so I didn\\'t \\n\\nmyself receive the money.    The guardian who was with the children that time was \\n\\nthe one who was paying fees.    And if you want more clarification you can go to and \\n\\nthen they will give you more sufficient because I wasn\\'t -- I wasn\\'t in accounting.   \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 89 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 90/119 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nI don\\'t know.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:47:11] Well let me be very, very clear.    I\\'m not suggesting that you \\n\\nwere -- they were giving you this money and that you were using it for other \\n\\npurposes, not here at least, so ...     \\n\\nBut when you were, as you indicated, you had the children in private schools, did \\n\\nyou get a bill once a year or did you have to pay in instalments?    And do you recall \\n\\nhow much money you were paying at the time when your children -- when you were \\n\\npaying for the private education? \\n\\nA.      [14:47:40] It was every term.    But if you want to pay the whole year, you pay \\n\\nthe whole year.    If you want to pay every term, it\\'s up to you. \\n\\nQ.      [14:47:56] Okay.    And do you know whether these amounts would be for \\n\\na term or a whole year? \\n\\nA.      [14:48:01] I\\'ve no idea, your Honour.    As I told you -- can I explain, \\n\\nyour Honour?   \\n\\nQ.      [14:48:08] Yes, please.    Please, please, please.   \\n\\nA.      [14:48:08] As I told you, I was away from, so the people which were sending fee \\n\\nstructure to OTP or VWU was -- according to they could not send, and then after \\n\\nthe payment they send the receipt.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:48:28] Okay.   \\n\\nA.      [14:48:29] So most of the things I didn\\'t know how much, because after \\n\\nthe security issue my children was transferred to in Eldoret town where I was.    So I \\n\\ndidn\\'t know that because I never ask and I was away from home.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:48:45] Okay.    Okay.    And -- and so -- but just, it\\'s a technical matter \\n\\nbecause I, you know -- how many terms does a year have? \\n\\nA.      [14:48:55] In Kenya it\\'s three terms. \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 90 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 91/119 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nQ.

Now you indicated at one point \\n\\nthat when you wanted to, or you could contact the -- the elder or chief in a village to \\n\\nget information.    I think that was something you had said earlier this morning to one \\n\\nof my questions.    So from that, I -- I suspect that you had the ability when you were \\n\\noutside Kenya to call and get information concerning your loved ones, including \\n\\nthe children.    Right?   \\n\\nA.      [14:49:35] You are mixing the words (Overlapping speakers). \\n\\nQ.      [14:49:40] If you could just answer my question.   \\n\\nA.      [14:49:42] No, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [14:49:43] Okay, so you could not -- you could not make phone calls \\n\\nfrom -- from outside in order to call your sister, for instance?    Be careful, you\\'re \\n\\nunder oath.   \\n\\nA.      [14:49:55] You are talking about number 36.    You are not talking about my \\n\\nsister. \\n\\nQ.      [14:49:59] Well, right now I\\'m giving you an example about.   \\n\\nA.      [14:50:02] But you didn\\'t say example, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [14:50:05] All right.    Could you communicate when you were    outside of \\n\\nKenya with your family members?    Could you? \\n\\nA.      [14:50:10] Yes.    Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [14:50:14] Did you communicate with your family members? \\n\\nA.      [14:50:20] I could communicate, but I was not accountant to know how much \\n\\nor -- it is between my sister and OTP.    And if you want more they have accountant, \\n\\nthey have receipt, and the schools are there, we can find out how much (Overlapping \\n\\nspeakers). \\n\\nQ.

Okay.    I\\'ve moved on.    I just want to know \\n\\nwhether you were able to communicate with your loved ones? \\n\\nA.      [14:50:52] Yes, I was. \\n\\nQ.      [14:50:52] To find out, to find out where, for instance, the children were being \\n\\nschooled? \\n\\nA.      [14:50:58] Yes, I could communicate and I was told they have gone to school or \\n\\nnot yet. \\n\\nQ.      [14:51:03] Okay.    And I take it you knew, did you -- or who selected \\n\\nthat -- the schools that they were going to, or were they the same schools that they \\n\\nhad been going to all along?   \\n\\nA.      [14:51:19] According to there were -- my sister was in there looking after them \\n\\nwhen I was away, so he was the one looking which school is having more security, \\n\\nand because you cannot go putting up school which doesn\\'t have security and \\n\\nmy -- my life was in danger.     \\n\\nQ.      [14:51:46] I understand.    Okay.    So it was your sister that selected the schools \\n\\nthat somebody else was going to pay for because you were away and couldn\\'t take \\n\\ncare of them.    That\\'s the essence of the story, right? \\n\\nA.      [14:51:59] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [14:52:00] Okay.    All right.    We can move on to another subject.

[14:52:55] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [14:52:56] Okay.    And further down, if we go down where it says \"Date(s) and \\n\\nTime(s)\", we see that it was May 15, 2013 and, boy, this looks like an eight-hour \\n\\ninterview. \\n\\nDo you see that?   \\n\\nA.      [14:53:15] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [14:53:17] Okay.    Now if we could -- could be so kind as to turn to page 5, \\n\\npage 5.    That would be KEN-OTP-0102-0182.   \\n\\nThis is another example where you were communicating with the Prosecution, \\n\\nincidentally. \\n\\nNow, if I could direct your attention to -- to paragraph   24.    And it says.   \\n\\n\"Yesterday [at] (14 May 2013) when I was travelling, I received a phone call from \\n\\n[person number 12] at 20:49.    He introduced himself and asked if he speaking to me, \\n\\nwhich I confirmed.    I asked him who gave him my number, but he refused to reveal \\n\\nthe name of the person.    I told him that I was not able to talk.    He said that he \\n\\nwould call me back later.\" \\n\\nDo you recall that? \\n\\nA.      [14:54:33] Yes, your Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:54:34] Okay.    And by that point, it seems from here that you were well \\n\\nacquainted with person number 12? \\n\\nA.      [14:54:48] I knew him before, your Honour.    And when I went to protection in \\n\\nKenya, I changed my number which we used to communicate before, and I had \\n\\na number which I handed over to investigators. \\n\\nQ.      [14:55:03] Right.   \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 93 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 94/119 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nA.      [14:55:05] So and that is the -- I was wondering who gave him my number \\n\\nbecause I changed the number which he was -- he knew it before. \\n\\nQ.      [14:55:15] Okay.    I do have a document that was provided to me by \\n\\nthe Prosecutor, which we\\'ll get to at some point, where you also note that you had \\n\\nmany numbers, many phones, many numbers.   \\n\\nA.      [14:55:28] The information which I talked with person -- this person wasn\\'t \\n\\naccurate because I knew that person wasn\\'t up to date, and things which he wanted \\n\\nme to say or to do wasn\\'t right for the Court.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:55:41] Okay.   \\n\\nA.      [14:55:42] So it reaches a point I was -- discussed with him I wanted to know, to \\n\\nexplore his mind because he wanted me to go to get a lawyer and stop talking to ICC. \\n\\nQ.      [14:55:59] Okay, well now we\\'re heading -- we\\'re jumping ahead of ourselves \\n\\na little bit, because you were jumping a few years ahead.   \\n\\nA.      [14:56:06] I was explaining why --   \\n\\nQ.      [14:56:07] I understand.     \\n\\nA.      [14:56:07] -- why that person was like most anything which I said to him wasn\\'t \\n\\naccurate. \\n\\nQ.      [14:56:13] I understand.   \\n\\nA.      [14:56:14] The information which was in the conversation, maybe the OTP got it \\n\\nin or tucked in was not accurate. \\n\\nQ.      [14:56:24] I understand.    I understand.    But we\\'re not talking about that period.   \\n\\nWe\\'re talking about now a telephone conversation that you had on 14 May 2013.   \\n\\nOkay.    This is -- I want to concentrate on this one, not the ones that follow, \\n\\nthe 44 hours, 2 minutes and 57 seconds. \\n\\nSo if we go to paragraph 25, you say:   \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 94 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 95/119 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\n\"I know [person number 12] very well [very well] because we come from the same \\n\\narea and we were together in [this political party] in 2007.    Before 2007 I had heard of \\n\\nhim but we had never met.    After [person number 12] left Kenya, he contacted me \\n\\nonce.    I believe it was in mid-2011.    At that time, I was in a witness protection \\n\\nprogramme run by [organisation 13].    [Person number 12] asked me why I had not \\n\\ngone with him and the rest of the witnesses to The Hague.\" \\n\\nDo you recall having that conversation? \\n\\nA.      [14:58:07] I recall. \\n\\nQ.      [14:58:07] And you recall passing on this information as it\\'s reflected here? \\n\\nA.      [14:58:12] Yes, I pass it. \\n\\nQ.      [14:58:14] Okay.    Now --   \\n\\nA.      [14:58:15] Because I knew the investigators and there was -- it was ICC witness, \\n\\nso.     \\n\\nQ.      [14:58:18] Okay, I\\'m just -- I just want to make sure that -- now here we are \\n\\ngoing to fast forward a little bit and we\\'re going to go to 2021, 2021.    We\\'re going to \\n\\nlook at tab 45.    Tab 45, which is in binder 2.    And we\\'ve looked at this before.    I\\'m \\n\\nnot going to go into all of your explanations concerning this gentleman, but just to \\n\\ntouch on one issue.    So when you get to tab 45, let me know.    Binder 2, tab 45.   \\n\\nA.      [14:59:10] Yes, I have it. \\n\\nQ.      [14:59:11] And it\\'s KEN-OTP-0160-0609, and I want to focus your attention, and \\n\\nin fairness to you, Ma\\'am, I will get back to this document because here you give your \\n\\nfull explanation of your relationship and your conversations with the gentleman, so \\n\\nyou will get a chance, but I just want to focus your attention for right now on \\n\\nparagraph 58, which is on page 16, which is on page 16, and it\\'s KEN-OTP-0160-0619.   \\n\\nSo if you could be so kind as to go to paragraph 58 on page 11, and when you get \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 95 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 96/119 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nthere let me know.    Paragraph 58, page 11. \\n\\nAnd for clarification for the -- for the record, this is your interview in 2021 where \\n\\nMr Steynberg was present.    I don\\'t know whether he was present on this particular \\n\\nday because this is a multiple day, multiple hour interview.    I would call it proofing \\n\\nsession.     \\n\\nBut, in any event, if we look at paragraph 58:   \\n\\n\"I cannot recall the first time when [person number 12] called me but it was when \\n\\nI was still in Kenya.    It was before I gave a statement to the ICC.    [Before I gave \\n\\na statement to the ICC.] \\n\\nI cannot remember who gave [person number 12] my number.\"   \\n\\nAnd then you say: \"In my previous statements I had informed the OTP about [person \\n\\nnumber 12] ...\"   \\n\\n(Counsel confer)   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:01:32] \\n\\nQ.      [15:01:33] Okay.    And I - I skipped, I skipped something where -- where it says:   \\n\\n\"They told me that they were witnesses and they lived in the Netherlands\".    Do you \\n\\nrecall that? \\n\\nA.      [15:01:48] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:01:48] And that\\'s what you said last summer, 2021? \\n\\nA.      [15:01:54] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:01:55] Okay.    And you say here that:    \"It was before I gave a statement to \\n\\nthe ICC.\"    Well, we\\'ve being going through lots of statements.    We know your first \\n\\nstatement was, at least for -- for the main case, in December 1 and 2 of 2012.    We \\n\\ntalked about some of these other statements.    The Prosecution made an intervention.   \\n\\nAnd here you\\'re saying that you talked to this person before you gave your statement. \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 96 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 97/119 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nNow, this is when he called you, right?    Now are we talking about -- are we talking \\n\\nabout the 2011 call where you say he might have -- you might have had this \\n\\nconversation with him?    Or are you talking about the time when he\\'s asking you \\n\\nwhy aren\\'t you in The Hague with the rest of us? \\n\\nA.      [15:02:56] Your Honour, I was talking about before.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:02:58] I see.    I see.    So when you said:    \"They told me that they are \\n\\nwitnesses\", who is \"they\"?    The Prosecution told you?   \\n\\nA.      [15:03:13] Themselves. \\n\\nQ.      [15:03:13] Themselves.    Well, who are they, who are -- could you -- was it more \\n\\nthan one person?   \\n\\nA.      [15:03:25] According to -- to them, they\\'re well known because they went \\n\\non -- on media, so they were well known in Kenya that those are ICC witnesses. \\n\\nQ.      [15:03:36] Well, could it be number 5?    Could number 5 be there, be one of \\n\\nthem?   \\n\\nA.      [15:03:55] Yes, your Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:03:58] And were there anybody else or just those two?   \\n\\nA.      [15:04:06] There were other two. \\n\\nQ.      [15:04:08] Okay.    And were they -- were they calling you, or were you calling \\n\\nthem, or were you all calling each other?    Which of the three? \\n\\nA.      [15:04:19] I never called three of them.    But the one who was calling me is \\n\\nperson number 12. \\n\\nQ.      [15:04:33] Okay.    And what about? \\n\\nA.      [15:04:35] That is he started calling me, but I never talked to the others until \\n\\nwhen I came here. \\n\\nQ.      [15:04:40] Okay.    All right.    That\\'s fine.    Well, I just wanted to clarify that \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 97 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 98/119 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\npoint. \\n\\nIf we could go now to the next document, tab 79.

[15:06:14] It\\'s starting from 50, tab 50.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:06:19] You don\\'t have a tab 79? \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:06:26] It starts from tab 51.

Could you please look at it.     \\n\\nDo you see it?    Okay.   \\n\\nA.      [15:07:24] Yeah, I can see, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:07:26] Okay.    Can I pose the question or you still want to read it?   \\n\\nA.      [15:07:30] You can pose the question. \\n\\nQ.      [15:07:31] Okay.    Now, this is dated 25 May 2003 --   \\n\\nA.      [15:07:35] Thirteen.     \\n\\nQ.      [15:07:35] Thirteen.    Sorry, sorry, I\\'m getting a little tired here: \"She received \\n\\nthe 78,100 Kenyan shillings for the first term fees yesterday.\"    Okay.    Do you see \\n\\nthat? \\n\\nA.      [15:08:02] Yes, I can see (Overlapping speakers). \\n\\nQ.      [15:08:04] So it would now appear that, at least for one term, I don\\'t know \\n\\nwhether it\\'s for one or two or three children, it\\'s 78,000.    \"She received\", does that \\n\\nmean that you received it or it was paid?   \\n\\nA.      [15:08:25] It was paid. \\n\\nQ.

[15:08:53] Yes, your Honour, but she wasn\\'t feeling well. \\n\\nQ.      [15:08:55] I understand.    I just want to -- I just want clarification because you \\n\\nhad more than one sister, right?    Or no, is she the only one? \\n\\nA.      [15:09:03] No, I have more. \\n\\nQ.      [15:09:05] okay.    Well, that\\'s why I\\'m asking for the -- it\\'s just clarification, you \\n\\nknow, just to be precise: \\n\\n\"However she gave this figure on the spur of the moment, after consulting with her \\n\\nsister, she believes that her sister will require 20,000 Kenyan shillings/month.\" \\n\\nThis money, where was it coming from?    Was it the OTP, because this is an OTP \\n\\nreport?    So can I assume that this is money given or provided to you or your family \\n\\nmembers by the Prosecution?   \\n\\nA.      [15:09:46] I don\\'t know where it came from, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:09:49] Okay.   \\n\\nA.      [15:09:49] But I just give the message and then it was ... \\n\\nQ.      [15:09:54] Right.    And when you were in their care, somebody else was paying \\n\\nfor your expenses, right, your accommodations, your food, your -- you know, to top \\n\\nup your phone and all of that, right? \\n\\nA.      [15:10:11] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:10:12] And were you also getting some sort of an allowance, if you want to \\n\\ncall it that, some spending money? \\n\\nA.      [15:10:19] It was -- was little money. \\n\\nQ.

[15:11:16] Talked with person number 64 last month, and he told you that he is \\n\\nlooking for some new OTP witnesses to see if he can get them to withdraw.    Do you \\n\\nsee that? \\n\\nA.      [15:11:33] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:11:34] Now, where were you?    In what location were you at this time?    Or, \\n\\nyou know, the month before? \\n\\nA.      [15:11:46] I don\\'t remember, your Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:11:48] All right.    And person number 64, did you know him?   \\n\\nA.      [15:11:56] Yes, your Honour.    I know him when we met in -- when we were \\n\\ngiving out WAKI report, and he\\'s the one who disclosed me, that is why I was in -- on \\n\\nthe run, then I went for protection.    He is the one who disclosed my --   \\n\\nQ.      [15:12:18] Your identity? \\n\\nA.      [15:12:19] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [15:12:19] And that\\'s why you decided to -- to go in hiding?    And that is why \\n\\nyou decided to go in hiding?    I\\'m just -- right? \\n\\nA.      [15:12:28] Because they want to (Overlapping speakers). \\n\\nQ.      [15:12:30] Right.

Was it in person \\n\\nor was it over the phone?   \\n\\nA.      [15:13:09] I think it\\'s over the phone. \\n\\nQ.      [15:13:12] Now when you say you think? \\n\\nA.      [15:13:14] I don\\'t remember. \\n\\nQ.      [15:13:15] I see, okay.    That falls in the category \"I don\\'t remember\", \"I don\\'t \\n\\nknow.\"   \\n\\nA.      [15:13:19] I don\\'t remember.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:13:20] Okay.    And do you remember, by any chance, whether he contacted \\n\\nyou or you contacted him, or it was just by happenstance, by serendipity that \\n\\nthis -- this meeting or this talk took place?   \\n\\nA.      [15:13:42] Your Honour, I don\\'t remember meeting him.    On the conversation it \\n\\nwas through phone, because I already knew this person was and then I don\\'t -- I \\n\\nwasn\\'t comfortable meeting anyone anyway, so (Overlapping speakers). \\n\\nQ.      [15:13:59] I understand that.    But now, see now you\\'re embellishing a little bit.   \\n\\nFirst you say you don\\'t know, now you\\'re saying it was for sure a conversation over \\n\\nthe phone.    So you either remember or you don\\'t remember.    You can\\'t have it both \\n\\nways, but -- and I think we established that you said you don\\'t remember. \\n\\nBut might I add -- might I ask, do you recall having this conversation?   \\n\\nA.      [15:14:30] It has been long time, I don\\'t remember.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:14:33] Okay.    So if I were to press you for more information on this \\n\\nparticular conversation, I suspect the answer that we would be getting is \"I don\\'t \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 101 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 102/119 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nremember.\"     \\n\\nIf I would press you for details on this, we would -- your answer would probably \\n\\nhave to be \"I don\\'t remember\".   \\n\\nA.      [15:14:58] I will answer which I know, which I remember.    But if I don\\'t \\n\\nremember, I don\\'t want to give a guesswork or assume. \\n\\nQ.      [15:15:06] Okay.    So as of this -- right now, just to be clear, you don\\'t remember \\n\\nwhether this person -- whether you had a conversation with this person in which he \\n\\ntold you he was looking for -- for OTP witnesses to withdraw?   \\n\\nA.      [15:15:23] My answer is I remember. \\n\\nQ.      [15:15:26] Okay.   \\n\\nA.      [15:15:27] I know I had conversation, but I don\\'t remember exactly when was it. \\n\\nQ.      [15:15:32] Now, when you had this conversation with this person, did you know \\n\\nthat he had exposed you?    You said that he exposed you, caused you to go on the \\n\\nrun.    Did you know that he was the one responsible for exposing you?   \\n\\nA.      [15:15:51] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:15:53] Okay.    And did -- and obviously he knew that he had exposed you, \\n\\nif -- if indeed that\\'s what happened, right?   \\n\\nA.      [15:16:05] He knew that I had kept in contact and he was also -- he \\n\\nwanted -- also he was -- he was in newspaper and he was on radio.    He was talking \\n\\nfreely about ICC, so -- and it was anybody who went for WAKI report, they were \\n\\nsuspecting that he is with ICC.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:16:27] Okay.   \\n\\nA.      [15:16:28] So everybody was trying his best to get to know who is who.    And \\n\\nbecause he was there, he knew very well that so and so and so, we were together \\n\\nwhen we were giving WAKI report.    So he was using that opportunity.

[15:16:47] Yeah, I\\'m listening, I\\'m listening.   \\n\\nA.      [15:16:50] The other side knew also.    (Redacted) knows people in that side. \\n\\nQ.      [15:16:56] Okay.    Alright.    We have to be careful not to say any -- I think we\\'re \\n\\nin -- in public session.    So I kindly ask you not to mention any names or places. \\n\\nAnd then if we go to the very last section, the very last point, it says that -- I don\\'t \\n\\nhave the number right off the bat, but my cheat sheet, but it looks like 53, is it?    Okay.   \\n\\nHold on.    One moment, your Honour.     \\n\\n(Counsel confer)   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:     \\n\\nQ.      [15:17:45] That person number 63, his wife, had a conversation with you.    Do \\n\\nyou see that?    To tell you that person number 62 has been hired by the other side.   \\n\\nDo you see that?   \\n\\nA.      [15:18:11] Yes, your Honour.    She told me.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:18:12] Okay.    So this is again information that somebody is telling you.   \\n\\nPresumably, she heard it from somebody else, right? \\n\\nA.      [15:18:24] I -- I can confirm it to you, your Honour, that this information was \\n\\ntrue, because in the recording I spoke to that person and he said he came to location \\n\\nwhere he was, he met and he left a message for me.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:18:41] Okay.    So this is one of those occasions where you actually had \\n\\nevidence that would support what his wife was -- was telling you.    That\\'s what \\n\\nyou\\'re telling us? \\n\\nA.      [15:18:58] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:18:59] So just to make sure I understand this - and this is a critical \\n\\npoint - that -- that this person confirmed to you what his wife had learned from him, \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 103 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 104/119 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nand that\\'s why you could say with such certainty that indeed this is a fact?   \\n\\nA.      [15:19:35] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:19:35] Okay.    Thank you. \\n\\nIf we go on to the next document.    And this is in tab, tab 41.    Binder 2, tab 41. \\n\\nDo you have it?   \\n\\nA.      [15:20:47] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:20:48] Okay.    Now this document is dated May 26, 2013.    And again it \\n\\nappears that you are contacting the OTP investigators to give them more information.   \\n\\nSo you\\'re like an investigator out there in the field gathering information, learning \\n\\nand passing it on to the investigators.   \\n\\nA.      [15:21:15] Your Honour, I was not investigator, but I was supporting them to get \\n\\ninformation, the truth about post-election violence, what happened. \\n\\nQ.      [15:21:25] And it just so happened that everybody was talking to you and that\\'s \\n\\nwhy you were able to facilitate that information from them to the OTP?   \\n\\nA.      [15:21:35] Even people didn\\'t know that I was in contact with them, but because \\n\\nof other witnesses went and reported that I am in contact with them.    That is \\n\\nthe reason all these things was -- was paused.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:21:52] I thought -- I thought you said earlier that everybody assumed that if \\n\\nyou were being protected by them you were automatically with the ICC.    That was \\n\\nan assumption, it went without saying.    That\\'s what you told us earlier.   \\n\\nA.      [15:22:06] What did you say?   \\n\\nQ.      [15:22:07] That it was people believed, whether it was true or not, that you \\n\\nalready were on the ICC side because you were being protected by them.    That\\'s \\n\\nwhat you told us.   \\n\\nA.      [15:22:21] No, your Honour.    Let me clear.    What I said is people in the village, \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 104 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 105/119 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nthey don\\'t understand between human rights and ICC.    They think they work \\n\\ntogether.    So whenever you were working with human rights, they assume it is ICC.   \\n\\nSo even when I was with human rights they were still thinking I was with ICC.    And \\n\\nthey were all over, because I remember one incident I went to a church and then one \\n\\nvillage elder stand in front and say there are two people had come out and we expect \\n\\nthose ones which are around to come out and talk and say publicly we declare we are \\n\\nno longer with.    So it was just assumption, because I didn\\'t support the other side, so \\n\\nit was all of them was against me, thinking that I am in that ...   \\n\\nQ.      [15:23:19] I understand, Ma\\'am.    I understand totally.    And you said \\n\\nthe assumption was that if you were -- if you were in hiding that you were with \\n\\nthe ICC.    That\\'s what -- that\\'s the impression that you gave us earlier.    Just like \\n\\nyou\\'re saying that because you were in human rights the assumption was you were \\n\\nwith the ICC.     \\n\\nA.      [15:23:36] Yes, if you go hiding they think you are with ICC. \\n\\nQ.      [15:23:44] Right.    So if they think that you\\'re with the ICC ...   \\n\\nA.      [15:23:48] So they keep on trying, asking, are you one of them, so they can bribe \\n\\nyou.    And if I was -- all this is assumption, why did they -- your client pay money to \\n\\nthe other witnesses?    Because if it was true (Overlapping speakers)   \\n\\nQ.      [15:24:06] Earlier -- Ma\\'am, Ma\\'am, earlier today you told us that you never met \\n\\nhim, you never heard from him, you never had any contact with him.    But now \\n\\nyou\\'re saying as if you know that this occurred.    Now I understand --   \\n\\nA.      [15:24:19] According to --   \\n\\nQ.      [15:24:21] I under -- according to what you were being told? \\n\\nA.      [15:24:22] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.

[15:25:56] It\\'s there, but I don\\'t remember. \\n\\nQ.      [15:25:57] You don\\'t remember.

[15:29:02] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:29:03] Okay.    And if you look at the first part, it says that you advised OTP \\n\\ninvestigators that individuals suspected of working for -- for Ruto were involved in \\n\\nattempting to locate witnesses.    This is one of -- another one of those occasions, and \\n\\nthen we see three particular names.    Do you see that? \\n\\nYou\\'re passing on information again what you heard to the OTP, right? \\n\\nA.      [15:30:00] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:30:00] And then it goes on, it says P -- it says that you are expecting that at \\n\\nleast one of them will attempt to you dissuade you from testifying, by offering \\n\\nsomething. \\n\\nDo you see that?   \\n\\nA.      [15:30:22] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:30:23] So you were forecasting that one of those three people is bound to try \\n\\nto tempt me not to testify by offering me money.    You were forecasting it?   \\n\\nA.      [15:30:44] No, your Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:30:45] Okay.    We can move on to tab 56. \\n\\nA.      [15:31:01] In the same binder, your Honour?   \\n\\nQ.      [15:31:03] I\\'m sorry, binder number 3.    Binder number 3.    Apologies. \\n\\nDo you have it? \\n\\nA.      [15:31:48] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:31:49] Okay.    And this is KEN-OTP-0117-0155.    It\\'s dated July 20, 2013.   \\n\\nAnd it says: \"The witness sent a text message to FOLC that reads ...\" that (Redacted) \\n\\nwas attacked last night (Redacted).    Do you see that?   \\n\\nA.      [15:32:29] Yes, your Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:32:30] Okay.    Then if we go to tab 50 -- tab 57.

[15:33:21] Yes, your Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:33:23] Okay.    Now if we go to tab 33, which is in binder 2.     \\n\\nI apologise, these are not in order.    I keep shifting everything so -- as I rework my \\n\\ncross.     \\n\\nDo you have it?    Do you have it?    Tab 33.    Tab 33.    This is another one of those \\n\\nreports.    It\\'s a witness statement, but it\\'s a continuation of the same thing.    And \\n\\nthe KEN number is OTP-0111-0162.     \\n\\nAnd I should have mentioned the other two KEN numbers.    I apologise.    For 56, \\n\\ntab 56 it should be 0117-1055, and for tab 57 it is KEN-OTP-0117-0915.    Apologies. \\n\\nNow, here we have a witness statement, it\\'s by you and we can see the date.    In fact \\n\\nthere are multiple dates, 17, 20, 21, 22 July 2013 over extended periods of time.    Do \\n\\nyou see that?    The bottom of the page.   \\n\\nA.      [15:35:52] Yes, your Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:35:54] All right.    And then if we look at paragraph 44, paragraph 44, which \\n\\nis on page 9, on KEN-OTP-10 -- OTP-0111-0170.    On paragraph 44 you seem to give \\n\\na description.     \\n\\nIf you could look at 42, 43 and 44, they relate to this incident, right? \\n\\nA.      [15:36:32] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:36:32] And it was during this time that it was suggested that perhaps you \\n\\ncould call (Redacted), get him on the phone and tape-record him, right?    So he   \\n\\ncould relate to you what had happened.

[15:36:54] Yes, your Honour, I was with investigator when I was talking to   \\n\\n(Redacted). \\n\\nQ.      [15:36:59] Exactly.    The investigator wanted you to call him up on the spot, \\n\\nwhich I assume they could have done and did do on other occasions, to have you call \\n\\nsomebody, tape record them to get the story, right?    And that\\'s what happened here, \\n\\nyou called (Redacted)? \\n\\nA.      [15:37:18] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:37:18] Okay.    Now if we look at tab 53, which is in binder 2.    Binder 3, \\n\\napologies.    Binder 3.    And it\\'s KEN-OTP-0160-1362.     \\n\\nAnd here, when you find it, I\\'m afraid we have it only in English, and if you see \\n\\nthe red marks, when you get to it --   \\n\\nA.      [15:37:51] You are saying tab?   \\n\\nQ.      [15:38:08] The tab, I\\'m sorry, tab 53, tab 53.    The translation was corrected \\n\\nrecently.    Or as the OTP puts it, enhanced.    And so the red markings are \\n\\nthe enhancement of the transcription and the translation.    And so if we begin we \\n\\ncould see the initials.    Do you see your initials?    If you look at page 1.    Just look at \\n\\npage 1 at the very top, you don\\'t have to page through all of these.   \\n\\nA.      [15:38:58] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:38:59] And those -- do you see your initials? \\n\\nA.      [15:39:01] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:39:03] And the other initials, are those of (Redacted)?   \\n\\nA.      [15:39:06] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:39:07] Okay.    And I don\\'t think I want to read all of it, but if you were to \\n\\nspend a minute or so in looking over up until, say, line 25, to tell us whether this was \\n\\nthe conversation that you were having with (Redacted) when you were asked   \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 110 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 111/119 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nto -- to tape-record him - unbeknownst to him, by the way, he didn\\'t know that he \\n\\nwas being tape-recorded, not that it matters - and tell us whether this is \\n\\nthe conversation.   \\n\\nA.      [15:39:56] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:39:58] Okay.    If we go to line 25, just for a little context.

The point I think -- I don\\'t need to read \\n\\non.    Maybe a couple of more lines, but you\\'ll see there are no names being \\n\\nmentioned. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [15:41:06] But my learned friend has mentioned a relationship \\n\\nand a specific incident and a specific conversation. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:41:13] Yes, Mr Karnavas, I think let\\'s go into \\n\\nprivate session for a little bit. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    Yes.   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:41:18] Madam Court Officer, please kindly get us \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 111 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 112/119 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Private Session)                                              ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\ninto private session. \\n\\n(Private session at 3.41 p.m.) \\n\\nTHE COURT OFFICER:    [15:41:32] We\\'re in private session, Madam President. \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 112 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 113/119 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Private Session)                                              ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nPage redacted – private session \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 113 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 114/119 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Private Session)                                              ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nPage redacted – private session \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 114 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 115/119 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Private Session)                                              ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nPage redacted – private session \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 115 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 116/119 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Open session at 3.49 p.m.) \\n\\nTHE COURT OFFICER:    [15:49:15] We are back in open session, Madam President. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:49:18] Thank you very much, Madam Court \\n\\nOfficer. \\n\\nAnd I note that we just released the witness.    Cross-examination will continue \\n\\ntomorrow. \\n\\nYes, Mr Karnavas, over to you, please. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:49:31] Thank you.    Thank you, your Honour.     \\n\\nOver the lunch break, over the lunch break the Prosecution provided us with \\n\\na courtesy copy of a victim application form and it\\'s, as I understand it, for the next \\n\\nwitness.    Now, this victim\\'s application form was filled out on 17 March 2011.    So \\n\\nwe received it today at approximately 1.43 p.m.    The witness is scheduled to start on \\n\\nMonday.     \\n\\nNow I understand that, in trying these sort of cases where there are lots of documents \\n\\nand what have you, things just fall through the cracks, it just happens.    But I have to \\n\\nsay that, and I don\\'t mean this disrespectfully because I know that my learned \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 116 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 117/119 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\ncolleague on the other side is trying his level best, but it\\'s not enough.    He has plenty \\n\\nof people, and maybe that\\'s the problem, he\\'s got too many people, too much staff, \\n\\nthat\\'s why they -- they can\\'t get their act together to provide us with the disclosure \\n\\nmaterial on time.    And I\\'m being very blunt. \\n\\nI think this is not going to make or break our weekend.    We\\'re not going to show up \\n\\nasking for a continuance because somehow this document is preventing us from \\n\\ngetting a fair trial.    But what I am suggesting, and I\\'m putting my marker down \\n\\nbecause I\\'ve been -- I\\'ve been rather patient and I\\'ve been rather generous in letting \\n\\nthem slide.    Even when the -- your Honour has been telling them over and over \\n\\nagain this is not the first time, second time, third time, they have been -- you have \\n\\nbeen warning them that they needed to be a little bit more careful.     \\n\\nI\\'m hoping that this is the last time that I\\'m going to receive late disclosure material.   \\n\\nIf they have other late material to disclose, they ought to tell us that maybe there\\'s \\n\\nother stuff forthcoming with other witnesses so we can make an application.    But \\n\\ncertainly, if it\\'s something serious, I will be asking that it not be admitted. \\n\\nAnd again, I understand things fall through the cracks.    I don\\'t wish to embarrass \\n\\nanyone, but it puts us in a very difficult position.    It taxes our limited resources and \\n\\nit tests our patience.    Thank you. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:52:33] Certainly, because you also have to prepare \\n\\nfor your case.   \\n\\nMr Steynberg, do you have any comments to make, and if so do you -- I want you to \\n\\naddress the Court on whether or not you have more disclosure materials, in fact. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [15:52:50] Your Honour, firstly this also came to my attention.    I \\n\\nhave been in court all day and all day yesterday, as you know, so it\\'s the persons that \\n\\nhave been preparing this witness that discovered this document that was overlooked.   \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 117 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 118/119 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nI cannot speak to the circumstances of it as I stand here today.     \\n\\nBut I\\'m just trying to grasp the logic of my learned friend\\'s argument that -- that when \\n\\nhe asked me if there are any other overlooked documents that I might want to \\n\\ndisclose.    I mean, it\\'s not like I\\'m withholding -- we\\'re withholding documents that \\n\\nwe know we have, but we have an ongoing, obviously, duty of disclosure, and if and \\n\\nwhen documents come to our attention that ought to have been disclosed and will be \\n\\ndisclosed, then they have been and will be provided to the Defence as soon as \\n\\npossible, as we\\'ve done in this case. \\n\\nFor the record, my learned friend says he would object to this material being admitted.   \\n\\nThis is not being disclosed as INCRIM, and we don\\'t rely on this.    We\\'re providing \\n\\nthis to my learned friend so that he can prepare, and we provided as soon as we \\n\\nfound it, which was today. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:54:00] Well, what I can say is that you have to try \\n\\na little bit more, Mr Prosecutor, so that you disclose documents or evidence in \\n\\na timely manner.    Because, you know, you have to be -- we have to be fair to \\n\\nthe Defence, they have to prepare their case.    It\\'s a case against them, they have to \\n\\nreally, really try to, you know, appear before the courts to know what they\\'re doing.   \\n\\nBut if you disclose late, I mean like Mr Karnavas is saying, that\\'s not too good. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [15:54:31] Understood, your Honour.    And obviously we \\n\\napologise for this oversight.    But, I mean, my learned friend is implying that has \\n\\nhappened repeatedly, and as far as I\\'m aware there have been a very limited number \\n\\nof oversights, considering the volume of documents.    I mean if one were to do \\n\\na calculation as to the number of thousands of pages that have been disclosed by \\n\\nthe deadline and the number that have been discovered since, it\\'s -- it\\'s -- honestly, it\\'s \\n\\na drop in the ocean.     \\n\\n24.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 118 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-056-Red-ENG WT 24-02-2022 119/119 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nBut, of course, our wish is that we pick up and disclose everything by the necessary \\n\\ndeadlines, and of course where we -- where we fall short of that standard we will \\n\\nobviously apologise and do our best to rectify as soon as we can. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:55:16] Thank you very much.    Thank you.     \\n\\nMr Karnavas. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:55:17] Nothing, your Honour.    I just -- I take -- I take \\n\\nthe gentleman at his word and, yes, there have been some late disclosure, but overall \\n\\nthere have been instances where, with all due respect, they\\'ve been less than diligent.   \\n\\nAnd it\\'s been pointed out to them, not by me, but by the Chamber, in messages.    So I \\n\\nunderstand the gentleman is very busy and others are looking after it, but he is \\n\\nthe boss, he is the one in charge, he\\'s going take the blame.    And when he wins, he\\'ll \\n\\ntake the glory too, if he wins. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [15:55:49] Your Honour, if I may just add one other thing.    It \\n\\nwould have been nice if my learned friend -- he raised this issue at the beginning of \\n\\nthis session, he could have provided me with some -- a heads-up that he was going to \\n\\nraise this point.    He surprised me now and, obviously, now I\\'m expected to provide \\n\\nan answer to the Chamber, which puts me in a very difficult position when I\\'ve been \\n\\ngiven no notice of the issue that he wishes to raise. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:56:11] That\\'s okay.    That\\'s addressed. \\n\\nOn that note, we\\'re going to 4 o\\'clock now, so this Court stands adjourned.

We will continue. \\n\\nMadam Witness, let me now explain to you the protective measures that the Chamber \\n\\nhas put in place for your testimony.    The following measures are put in place to \\n\\nprotect you:   \\n\\nVoice and face distortion has been put in place for you for the duration of your \\n\\ntestimony.    This means that no one outside the courtroom can see your face or hear \\n\\nyour real voice during your testimony. \\n\\nThere will also be the use of pseudonym, so in accordance with that, we will all refer \\n\\nto you only as Madam -- only as \"Madam Witness\" to make sure that the public does \\n\\nnot know your name   \\n\\nwhen you answer questions; that will not give away who you are.    We will do so in \\n\\nopen session, which means that the public can hear what is being said in the \\n\\ncourtroom, even though they will not make out your voice.     \\n\\nWhen you are asked to describe anything that relates specifically to you, or you are \\n\\nasked to mention facts that might reveal your identity, we will do so in private \\n\\nsession.    In private session, there is no broadcast and no one outside the courtroom \\n\\ncan hear your answer.    If ever anything gets said during public session, which \\n\\nshould have been said in private session, we will do our best to protect that \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n23.02.2022 \\n\\n  Page 3 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-055-Red-ENG CT WT 23-02-2022 4/90 RH T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                  (Open Session)                                              ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\ninformation.    Your testimony will be broadcast on a daily basis, so we can remove \\n\\nany such remarks from the public broadcast. \\n\\nThe Prosecution has also prepared a list, so that you can safely make reference to \\n\\ninformation which might identify you.    The Prosecution will explain this to you \\n\\nwhen it begins its testimony. \\n\\nAnd lastly, I also have a few practical matters you should have in mind when giving \\n\\nyour testimony.    Everything you say here in this courtroom is interpreted and \\n\\nwritten down.    It is, therefore, important to speak clearly and at a slow pace.    Please \\n\\nspeak into the microphone, and only start speaking when the person asking you the \\n\\nquestion has finished.    To allow for the interpretation, everyone has to wait a few \\n\\nseconds before starting to speak. \\n\\nIf you have any questions yourself, raise your hand so we know that you wish to say \\n\\nsomething.     \\n\\nHave you understood all that I have said, Madam Witness? \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [9:39:52] I have understood, your Honour. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:39:57] Thank you very much.     \\n\\nSo we will now start with your testimony.     \\n\\nMr Steynberg, your witness. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [9:40:08] I\\'m grateful, your Honour.   \\n\\nQUESTIONED BY MR STEYNBERG:     \\n\\nQ.

[9:43:44] Now, besides these statements you gave to the Prosecution in what I \\n\\ncan call the main case, the case against Mr Ruto and Mr Sang that dealt with the \\n\\npost-election violence, did you also give other witness statements to the Prosecution? \\n\\nA.      [9:44:03] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [9:44:06] And what were those statements about, Madam?    Remembering we \\n\\nare in public session.   \\n\\nA.

[9:45:04] Thank you. \\n\\nIn that case, in your testimony today, I\\'m not going to ask you about each and every \\n\\nmatter which is contained in your various statements, and I think by my last count 11 \\n\\nconcerning witness tampering.    But rather I will focus on what the Prosecution \\n\\nconsiders to be the most important aspects or at least aspects on which I would like to \\n\\nask you certain further clarifications.     \\n\\nDo you understand? \\n\\nA.      [9:45:40] I understand. \\n\\nQ.      [9:45:43] But please bear in mind that the lawyers -- the lawyer for the Defence, \\n\\nwho will question you after me, and possibly the Judge may question you on any \\n\\nmatter, including matters in which I have not questioned you, provided they are \\n\\nrelevant to the case.    Okay? \\n\\nA.      [9:46:06] That\\'s fine. \\n\\nQ.      [9:46:08] All right.    Now during the course of Friday, Saturday and Sunday you \\n\\nwent through witness preparation process; is that right? \\n\\nA.      [9:46:29] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [9:46:30] And on the desk in front of you there should be a list, a table, the first \\n\\npage of which has yellow highlights on it.    Do you see that? \\n\\nA.

[9:47:19] Yes, I recognise.    And I went through and signed it. \\n\\nQ.      [9:47:24] All right.     \\n\\nFor the record, your Honour, this is the list of material shown to the witness during \\n\\nthe witness preparation session.    It\\'s also annex A to the witness clarification log \\n\\nprovided to my learned friends, and the ERN is KEN-OTP-0160-1579. \\n\\nYour Honour, just a note for the Defence, the disclosure process of this document is \\n\\nstill under way, so it has not been formally disclosed, but of course we have provided \\n\\nthe list to the Defence.    So what they don\\'t have is the document with the ticks, but \\n\\nthat\\'s in the process and it should be coming in the next disclosure package. \\n\\nAll right.    You say you signed the document.    Besides the signatures, did you make \\n\\nany other marks on this document? \\n\\nA.      [9:48:27] Yes, I put my initials. \\n\\nQ.      [9:48:30] Mm-hmm. \\n\\nA.      [9:48:32] And tick -- put tick and X. \\n\\nQ.      [9:48:38] All right.    And the ticks and Xs, what do they signify? \\n\\nA.      [9:48:44] Saying I have read. \\n\\nQ.      [9:48:48] You have read the document corresponding to the tick; is that correct? \\n\\nA.      [9:48:52] Correct. \\n\\nQ.      [9:48:53] All right.    Now I\\'m going to focus, to start off with, on the documents \\n\\nthat are highlighted in yellow.

And you confirm that you \\n\\nhave read all of these documents; is that right? \\n\\nA.      [9:49:43] Yes, I\\'ve read it. \\n\\nQ.      [9:49:46] You also made a few clarifications of certain documents, mainly \\n\\ncorrections to your personal details, one or two other spelling issues.    Subject to \\n\\nthose clarifications, do you confirm under oath today -- under oath today, the truth \\n\\nand correctness of these documents to the best of your knowledge and recollection? \\n\\nA.      [9:50:16] Yes, I confirm. \\n\\nQ.      [9:50:20] Right.     \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    Your Honour, I should say at this stage -- I should have placed it \\n\\non the record at the beginning, that during the clarification session the witness was \\n\\ngiven the warnings in terms of Rule 66(3) and Article 70.    In other words, she is \\n\\naware of her duty to tell the truth and the penalties should she not do so.    The \\n\\nProsecution also explained her rights under Rule 74, although the Prosecution does \\n\\nnot consider that Rule 74 will be implicated with this witness.     \\n\\nQ.      And you -- Madam Witness, just to confirm, you have no objection to the \\n\\nProsecution handing these statements into evidence? \\n\\nA.      [9:51:11] No objection, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:51:16] Thank you very much. \\n\\nPerhaps I can just, while I\\'m on this subject, ask you to turn to the -- page 10 of this \\n\\ndocument, where you\\'ll see from 127 to 129 some purple highlighted items.

[9:51:43] Yes, I have. \\n\\nQ.      [9:51:45] These are the transcripts of your evidence in the Ruto and Sang case.   \\n\\nCan you confirm you also read those? \\n\\nA.      [9:51:54] I read it, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:51:56] And the following items are highlighted in blue, items 130 to 133, and \\n\\nthese are your witness statements in what I\\'ve called the main case, the Ruto and Sang \\n\\ncase.    And have you also read those? \\n\\nA.      [9:52:14] Yes, I read it, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:52:17] Thank you. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [9:52:18] Your Honour, for the record, the Prosecution does not \\n\\nconsider these relevant for the Prosecution\\'s case, so we do not propose to submit \\n\\nthese documents into evidence, but of course they\\'re available to my learned friend to \\n\\nuse as he deems fit. \\n\\nYour Honour, the Prosecution will submit in the normal fashion into evidence the \\n\\ndocuments listed from items 1 to 47, being the prior recorded testimony of the witness \\n\\nconcerning the Article 70 case. \\n\\nIf the Court will bear with me, please. \\n\\n(Counsel confers)   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [09:53:28] Sorry, your Honour, I\\'m looking for an elusive Post-it.   \\n\\nI should just place on record the ERN of the witness clarifications.    It is \\n\\nKEN-OTP-0160-1594.

It\\'s on page -- \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:55:49] Court officer, please help the witness. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [9:55:51] It\\'s on page number 2, Madam Witness.    Page 2. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:55:56] Can you help the witness, please.   \\n\\nThank you. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:     \\n\\nQ.      [9:56:21] All right.    You won\\'t find it on the other document. \\n\\nA.      [9:56:28] Sorry about that. \\n\\nQ.      [9:56:30] No, no problem.    Do you have location 12 on the list, page 2? \\n\\nA.      [9:56:34] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:56:35] And is it correct you were relocated there?    Now I don\\'t want to give \\n\\nexact dates, we\\'re in public session, but sometime prior to April 2013; is that correct?   \\n\\nA.      [9:56:50] Correct, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:56:53] All right.    And while you were in that location, did it come to your \\n\\nattention at any time that people back home, back in Kenya, were looking for you? \\n\\nA.      [9:57:05] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:57:06] And how did this come to your attention? \\n\\nA.      [9:57:10] Through -- via phone call. \\n\\nQ.      [9:57:18] Through a phone call? \\n\\nA.      [9:57:20] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [9:57:21] Right.

[9:59:14] What is the number of the person that contacted you? \\n\\nA.      [9:59:18] Five-three, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:59:20] Person number 53.    Good.    Do you -- can I ask, do you have a pen \\n\\nwith you there? \\n\\nA.      [9:59:28] No. \\n\\nQ.      [9:59:29] Sorry, Madam Court Officer, to trouble you again.    Could the witness \\n\\nbe given a pen please.     \\n\\nPerhaps you can just put a cross next to that one so you can find it more easily next \\n\\ntime, because we\\'ll be coming back to this gentleman from time to time. \\n\\nA.      [9:59:52] Thank you. \\n\\nQ.      [9:59:53] All right.    Now, I\\'ll come back to this conversation with person 53 in \\n\\na moment, we will have to do that in private session.    But just to continue the \\n\\nnarrative to set the scene.    And you can -- you can put that document aside for now, \\n\\nMadam. \\n\\nA.      [10:00:31] Okay. \\n\\nQ.      [10:00:33] So this gentleman phoned you and gave you a report to the effect that \\n\\nthere were people looking for you.    What did you do as a result of that report?    Did \\n\\nyou tell anyone? \\n\\nA.      [10:00:50] Yes, your Honour, I told the investigators. \\n\\nQ.      [10:00:56] And can you recall how soon after the call you told the investigators? \\n\\nA.

[10:01:46] Madam, then, as a result of your report about this phone call to the \\n\\ninvestigators, what did they ask you to do?    What were you asked to do? \\n\\nA.      [10:01:57] They asked me to have a meeting with them. \\n\\nQ.      [10:02:04] With the investigators? \\n\\nA.      [10:02:05] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [10:02:07] And at that meeting did you provide a statement to them? \\n\\nA.      [10:02:10] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [10:02:11] All right.    And besides that, regarding these calls and any further \\n\\ncalls you might receive, what were you asked to do? \\n\\nA.      [10:02:21] They asked me to record the conversation. \\n\\nQ.      [10:02:28] I see.    And how were you going to record that conversation? \\n\\nA.      [10:02:35] Your Honour, first I was recording through my phone, and then later \\n\\nthey gave me recorder. \\n\\nQ.      [10:02:52] A recording -- a recording device, a recorder? \\n\\nA.      [10:02:55] Yes, correct. \\n\\nQ.      [10:02:57] Thank you.    So they asked you to record these conversations.    What \\n\\nwas your -- what was your response?    What was your attitude to that request? \\n\\nA.      [10:03:06] I agreed. \\n\\nQ.

[10:03:29] Not at all, your Honour.    It was on my own decision to do that. \\n\\nQ.      [10:03:34] Thank you.    And maybe I can just ask you, why did you agree? \\n\\nA.      [10:03:40] I agreed because I wanted justice for the victims of post-election \\n\\nviolence.    And when I saw calling me and asking me to be paid, I didn\\'t need that \\n\\nmoney.    The victims need that money.    That\\'s why I decide. \\n\\nQ.      [10:04:18] Okay.    Thank you.     \\n\\nNow, is it correct, Madam Witness, that over the ensuing months, you, in fact, \\n\\nrecorded a number of conversations -- and we will deal with the persons involved in \\n\\na moment, but these recordings were provided to the investigators; is that right? \\n\\nA.      [10:04:47] Yes.    After the recording, I handed over to the investigators, \\n\\nyour Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:04:55] And this happened periodically.    From time to time, you\\'d hand over \\n\\nthe recordings and you\\'d make a statement about what had happened; is that right? \\n\\nA.      [10:05:04] Correct, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:05:05] Right.    I\\'d like to -- I\\'d like to direct your attention then, please, to the \\n\\nother list, so the list with the highlights, so you can have these two documents handy.   \\n\\nThat and the protected information list.

And then if we then go down the list, all the way down \\n\\nfrom 48 to - goodness, you were busy - 126.    On roughly every second item, there \\n\\nshould also be a tick or a cross in the fourth column corresponding to the recording of \\n\\na conversation.    Correct? \\n\\nA.      [10:08:39] Correct, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:08:42] All right.    Madam, I know it\\'s difficult, but if I can just ask you, when \\n\\nyou are turning the pages to try not bump the microphone because that will mean \\n\\nthat nobody else will be able to hear what -- what\\'s being said, if anything, and I\\'ll try \\n\\nand stop talking while you\\'re changing pages.     \\n\\nOkay.    So can we accept then that each of these crossed items in the fourth column \\n\\nwas played to you or a portion was played to you during the witness preparation; is \\n\\nthat right?   \\n\\nA.      [10:09:20] Correct, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:09:21] And did you have the opportunity to compare those to the \\n\\ncorresponding transcripts in the second column? \\n\\nA.      [10:09:28] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [10:09:30] And were you able to identify these as recordings that you had made \\n\\nand to confirm the speakers - as recorded on the transcripts - the identities of the \\n\\nspeakers?   \\n\\nA.

But I\\'d like to -- you to \\n\\nindicate, please, to the best of your knowledge, which of the persons listed in the \\n\\nprotected information sheet - so, the other document - you had recorded \\n\\nconversations with.   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [10:10:57] Your Honour, I\\'m happy to do this in public session, \\n\\nbut it will probably take some time for the witness to go through what\\'s a fairly \\n\\nlengthy list.    Alternatively, we could go into private session and she can mention the \\n\\nnames and I can direct her to the appropriate place. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:11:15] To the numbers? \\n\\nMR

[10:29:04] Now, Madam Witness, we\\'re going to try to proceed in public session, \\n\\nand, again, I caution you to be very careful not to mention details that might identify \\n\\nyou and to use the list of protected information whenever you want to refer to \\n\\npersons or places. \\n\\nPerhaps I can just summarise.    While we were in public session, you told us about \\n\\nvarious conversations you had with person number 53 and how he was requested, \\n\\nwell, how he was present when there was a request by the accused - and I think I can \\n\\nsay this in public session since (Redacted)    - was asked to get   \\n\\na photograph of you. \\n\\nBesides the various phone calls you had and you recorded, were there any \\n\\ndiscussions with any of the persons whom you were interacting about a meeting, \\n\\na face-to-face meeting in location number 12? \\n\\nA.

[10:31:51] No.    There was one, but he came, but he met someone else, and then \\n\\nhe went back to Kenya and give me a call and say that he has met someone.    I should \\n\\nget in touch with that person so that I can get the whole -- full information. \\n\\nQ.      [10:32:09] All right.

[10:34:53] Thank you very much.    And so he told you he had come to location \\n\\n12 and met with person number 63.     \\n\\nAnd what else did he say? \\n\\nA.      [10:35:03] He said that he has left all information to person number 63.    I \\n\\nshould look for him so he can give me the full details of the meeting. \\n\\nQ.      [10:35:15] All right.    I\\'ll leave it at that, I think, for now.    Bear with me, please. \\n\\nAll right.    Now, you said you had -- there were discussions then with persons 53 and \\n\\n43 about meeting with you at location 12.    Did that meeting ever take place? \\n\\nA.      [10:35:57] No, your Honour, it didn\\'t take place, because the investigators asked \\n\\nme to -- they arranged the meeting, and then they asked me to go to the location.   \\n\\nAnd I give the call to person number 53, and he told me he will be there in five \\n\\nminutes.    So he told me he\\'s already -- he slept in location number ...      Number -- \\n\\nQ.      [10:36:31] The same location? \\n\\nA.

So he said that he arrived at night, he slept there, so it was \\n\\nduring the day.    So he told me that he will be in that location, and then he can have \\n\\nlunch.    And then I was in that location, I waited.    It was turning like 12 past.    He \\n\\nnever turned up.    So I gave him a call, and I asked him, why isn\\'t he here.    Is he lost \\n\\nin the location. \\n\\nQ.      [10:37:14] All right.    I think I\\'m going to have to stop you.

We\\'ll continue with your testimony in chief, Madam Witness.   \\n\\nAnd Mr Steynberg will continue putting questions to you and we\\'ll expect your \\n\\nanswers. \\n\\nMr Steynberg, your witness, please. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [11:33:15] Thank you, your Honour.     \\n\\nIf I may just clarify one issue perhaps, before we continue with the witness, and it \\n\\nconcerns a comment my learned friend made before the break, which has been \\n\\ntroubling me regarding whether or not the evidence of the witness is on record.     \\n\\nNow, my understanding is that the Prosecution has requested, and the Chamber has \\n\\ngranted, the Rule 63 request to enter the prior recorded statements of this witness into \\n\\nthe record, subject only to the witness\\'s lack of objection, which has been confirmed \\n\\ntoday.     \\n\\nSo my understanding is that obviously there\\'s still some formalities to follow, but that \\n\\nevidence is on record, which is not to say, of course, that I can lead this -- you know, \\n\\nask the question -- the witness leading questions on substantive issues, but that\\'s \\n\\nperhaps a separate issue.     \\n\\nSo if I can just confirm that my understanding is correct, the evidence is on record, but \\n\\n23.02.2022 \\n\\n  Page 36 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-055-Red-ENG CT WT 23-02-2022 37/90 RH T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                  (Open Session)                                              ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nwhen I\\'m dealing with substantive issues of evidence -- on issues that are in dispute, I \\n\\nshould not lead the witness, is that correct?   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [11:34:23] That is correct, Mr Steynberg. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [11:34:25] Thank you, your Honour.    I\\'m so guided.     \\n\\nAnd, your Honour, I\\'ve also taken to heart the request of the Chamber earlier, and my \\n\\nlearned friend, to try and date some of these matters.    And it\\'s always a balancing act \\n\\nto -- when one has Rule 68(3) to decide how much to actually lead and how much to \\n\\nrest on the statements.    But let me try and give a little bit of structure to what has \\n\\npassed already before I return to the document, which I was dealing with because I \\n\\ncan do this while we\\'re in open session, if I may. \\n\\nQ.      [11:35:01] Madam Witness, thank you for your patience.     \\n\\nIf I may just return to the initial contact that you mentioned in your statement this \\n\\nmorning -- in your evidence this morning from witness 53.

[11:37:31] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [11:37:32] And for the record, what date is that? \\n\\nA.      [11:37:36] Your Honour, the date is 29 April 2023 at 20:14. \\n\\nQ.      [11:37:51] Would you like to just have another look at the year, Madam Witness.   \\n\\nWe\\'re not quite at 2023 yet.     \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [11:37:57] Twenty-ninth April, which year, Madam \\n\\nWitness? \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [11:38:01] 2013. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [11:38:06] Thank you. \\n\\nQ.

[11:38:39] Your Honour, it was 15 May 2013. \\n\\nQ.      [11:38:44] All right.    I\\'d like you to have another look.    There\\'s two dates in \\n\\nthat sentence, one is relating to a telephone conversation and one is relating to \\n\\na meeting. \\n\\nA.      [11:38:58] Your Honour, the meeting of 15 May 2023 was with investigators. \\n\\nQ.      [11:39:05] Yeah.    And what was that meeting about? \\n\\nA.      [11:39:10] It was the following -- follow-up of the telephone conversation. \\n\\nQ.      [11:39:18] And what was the date of the telephone conversation?   \\n\\nA.      [11:39:22] It was 29 April. \\n\\nQ.      [11:39:23] Are you reading from paragraph 13, Madam?     \\n\\nI\\'m talking about -- sorry, I might have misled you.    I\\'m talking about the telephone \\n\\nconversation you report to the investigators, not your telephone conversation with \\n\\nperson 53.   \\n\\nA.      [11:39:40] Oh, sorry.    It was 30 April 2020 --   \\n\\nQ.      [11:39:42] 20 --   \\n\\nA.      [11:39:43] \\'13.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:39:43] 2013.   \\n\\nA.      [11:39:44] Mm.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:39:44] Thank you.    All right.     \\n\\nAnd as you\\'ve already mentioned, the date that you made this statement was 15 May.     \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [11:39:55] For the record, your Honour, the same telephone \\n\\nconversation is also dealt with in the next witness statement - I think I\\'ve already \\n\\n23.02.2022 \\n\\n  Page 39 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-055-Red-ENG CT WT 23-02-2022 40/90 RH T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                  (Open Session)                                              ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\nmentioned it, 0106-0910, at tab 4, from paragraphs 19 -- 18 onwards - but I won\\'t go to \\n\\nthat now. \\n\\nQ.      [11:40:24] Okay.    Now we\\'ve been discussing a conversation, which I\\'ll return \\n\\nto in a moment, with person 53, the date of which I\\'ve already placed on record was \\n\\n19 July.     \\n\\nBut just to date another incident you\\'ve mentioned.    You recall that you spoke this \\n\\nmorning about a planned meeting with person number 53 at location number 12 for \\n\\nwhich the person never arrived.    You recall that? \\n\\nA.      [11:41:00] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [11:41:02] And just to date that meeting -- well, can you recall the \\n\\nspecific - without saying it out loud - the specific location in location 12 where this \\n\\nmeeting was supposed to take place? \\n\\nA.      [11:41:22] Yeah, I remember it was --   \\n\\nQ.      [11:41:27] Can you maybe then just have a look at the list and see whether you \\n\\nrecognise that location before I show you your paragraph -- the relevant paragraph. \\n\\nA.      [11:41:41] Your Honour, it was location number 11. \\n\\nQ.      [11:42:29] Location number 11.    Thank you very much. \\n\\nAnd with that information on record -- well, can you recall -- are you able to recall \\n\\ntoday what the date of that meeting was?    The planned meeting.   \\n\\nA.      [11:42:47] It was on 29 April 2013. \\n\\nQ.      [11:42:54] Sorry, Madam, perhaps I\\'m misleading you.    I\\'m not talking \\n\\nabout -- I\\'m talking about the planned meeting with person number 53 at location 11.   \\n\\nDo you remember that or would you like to refresh your memory on that? \\n\\nA.      [11:43:11] Your Honour, I would like to refresh my memory on a screen.

[11:43:22] Shall I call it on the screen?     \\n\\nA.      -- on the screen. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [11:43:23] With the Court\\'s permission then, I will ask the court \\n\\nofficer to call up --   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [11:43:36] If I may be heard.    On the screen -- if I may be heard, \\n\\nyour Honour.    On the screen there\\'s a lot more information, and so she\\'s not just \\n\\nrefreshing her memory on the date, she\\'s also refreshing her memory on what else is \\n\\non the screen.     \\n\\nSo, if the source of the evidence is her memory, let her tell us that she doesn\\'t \\n\\nremember what happened or to give her testimony from her memory.    But not from \\n\\nthe screen. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [11:44:04] But if even she is -- I am looking at the tabs, \\n\\nwhatever documents we have here, you know, it\\'s not only the date that she will see \\n\\nfrom any document before us.    It\\'s basically the same that will appear on the screen. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [11:44:23] I understand, your Honour.    Right now the gentleman \\n\\nis trying to elicit her testimony.    The testimony should be coming from the source of \\n\\nthe evidence, her memory.    If she doesn\\'t recall, she can look at a document, she can \\n\\nrefresh her memory.    I don\\'t have a problem.     \\n\\nOtherwise, what\\'s the sense of having the witness here and going through this whole \\n\\nexercise in direct examination if the evidence is already in and she\\'s going to \\n\\nconstantly be looking at it and then -- and then reading from it, essentially.     \\n\\nSo either she remembers or doesn\\'t remember.     \\n\\nBut I would prefer the evidence coming from the witness. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [11:45:07] You have a point, Mr Karnavas. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [11:45:11] Your Honour, if I may briefly respond.

I don\\'t -- I don\\'t \\n\\npropose to revisit that issue.    The only thing I\\'m trying to do - and, this was actually \\n\\nin response to a request by my learned friend - is to try and date some of these events \\n\\nso we can bookmark them. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [11:45:32] But, yes, if the dates -- if the documents are \\n\\nin and you have them before you, why don\\'t you just -- well, state the date.     \\n\\nState the date, please. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [11:45:39] Very well, your Honour, I\\'m quite happy to do that.     \\n\\nSo I\\'m referring to, for the record - and please don\\'t call this up then for the \\n\\nWitness - to -- and I can\\'t recall if I read the ERN already.    It\\'s the statement of the \\n\\nwitness dated 20 August 2013.    The ERN is KEN-OTP-0111-0557.    I\\'m reading from \\n\\nparagraph 42, which is at page 0566.    And the date of the meeting with person 53 at \\n\\nlocation 11 is listed as 31 July.    Thank you, your Honour.    Very well.     \\n\\nYour Honour, with that, I will obviously continue to try and bookmark the dates as \\n\\nwe proceed, but that brings us more or less up to -- up to date.    So if I may return \\n\\nthen to the document I was busy with in private session, I\\'d be grateful. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [11:47:11] And would you like for us to do that in \\n\\nopen session, or --   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [11:47:14] Sorry, I should have been more clear, your Honour.    If \\n\\nwe can return to private session so that I may continue to deal with that document, \\n\\nplease. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [11:47:23] Madam Court Officer, can we go back to \\n\\nprivate session, please.

Thank you very much.   \\n\\nMr Steynberg, your witness, please. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [14:58:25] I\\'m grateful, your Honour.    And perhaps just to briefly \\n\\nsummarise, while we were in private session, we\\'ve gone through a series of three \\n\\ntranscripts of recorded phone calls and meetings that the witness had with persons 53, \\n\\nperson 62 and person 14 on the list of witnesses.

In -- yes, I think I can deal with this in \\n\\npublic session.     \\n\\nIn one of these discussions we mentioned, there was mention of a politician, an MP \\n\\nfrom Eldoret East, who was called Arap Lagat, was described as Arap Lagat.

[14:59:50] I don\\'t remember, your Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:59:51] All right, I\\'ll leave that there then. \\n\\nThen the last topic I just want to raise with you and give you an opportunity to \\n\\ncomment, are you aware that certain of the people who we\\'ve been discussing today \\n\\nsubsequently withdrew as witnesses and were summonsed to testify -- compelled to \\n\\ntestify in the Ruto and Sang case.    Did that come to your attention? \\n\\nA.      [15:00:30] Yes, your Honour.    I saw it online. \\n\\nQ.      [15:00:33] All right.    And for the record these people testified after you did, is \\n\\nthat right? \\n\\nA.      [15:00:39] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:00:42] And did it ever come to your attention that these people discussed \\n\\nyou and things you had allegedly done during their evidence?    Do you remember \\n\\nthat? \\n\\nA.

[15:11:22] Thank you, Madam Witness.   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [15:11:24]    That concludes my questioning for this witness.     \\n\\nI thank you for your patience, and I ask you please to extend my learned friend for \\n\\nthe Defence the same courtesy that you\\'ve given me.    Thank you. \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [15:11:37] Thank you, your Honour. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:11:39] Thank you very much Mr Steynberg. \\n\\nAnd Madam Witness, I am sure during your preparation, the Prosecution must have \\n\\ntold you that you will be cross-examined by Mr Karnavas, counsel for Mr Gicheru.   \\n\\nIs that so? \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [15:11:57] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:11:59] Okay.     \\n\\nMr Karnavas, it\\'s your time, it\\'s about 10 minutes after three.

So I can probably assure the Court \\n\\nthat even were I to start today, I might not finish tomorrow because there\\'s a lot of \\n\\ndocuments that have been moved in and so we may be going into Friday.     \\n\\nSo if you wish to break for the day, that\\'s fine.    If you want me to continue, I\\'ll need \\n\\nsome time just to set up, provide the binders, but I\\'m ready to go. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [15:12:45] Your Honour, if it helps your decision in terms of \\n\\nplanning, I can advise that the next witness -- the witness preparation will only start \\n\\ntomorrow, so he will not be ready to commence before Monday.     \\n\\nSo we have the whole of Thursday and Friday available in any event. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:13:01] Yes, so that witness -- I\\'m sure -- do you \\n\\nwant to assure the Chamber that that witness will be ready for Monday anyway? \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [15:13:11] Your Honour, yes, that is the plan. Certainly from the \\n\\nProsecution side, all the necessary arrangements will be necessary for Monday, yes. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:13:20] Thank you very much.    Mr Karnavas, since \\n\\nyou\\'ve indicated that, you know, we\\'ll go into Friday, maybe, you know, let\\'s take \\n\\na rest and come back tomorrow when we are all fresh. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:13:34] Thank you, your Honour. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:13:36] Madam Witness, we are going to break off \\n\\nhere for today, but when we come back tomorrow, Mr Karnavas will be putting \\n\\nquestions to you in cross-examination.    Okay?    After which maybe Mr Steynberg \\n\\nmay have questions for you in re-examination, but we are not yet there.     \\n\\nSo what I want for you to do is, as you leave here, do not discuss your testimony with \\n\\nanybody until we meet here again tomorrow morning --   \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [15:14:08] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n23.02.2022 \\n\\n  Page 89 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-055-Red-ENG CT WT 23-02-2022 90/90 RH T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                  (Open Session)                                              ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0613 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:14:09] -- is that understood?   \\n\\nYes.

I will request a redaction.    Thank you.    And \\n\\ndirection to the public gallery, if there is anyone. \\n\\nQ.      [10:04:15] Sir, it seems I am the one making the mistakes here.    Don\\'t worry \\n\\nabout it. \\n\\nSo let me ask you the question again.    You just mentioned that person number 19 at \\n\\nthis meeting tried to ask you about several issues concerning other people and \\n\\nconcerning the victims\\' meetings for ICC. \\n\\nSo I would like to ask you, do you recall if person 19 spoke to you about particular \\n\\nindividuals, asked you about particular individuals.    And, if necessary, please look \\n\\nat the list that you have in front of you.    And if you need to name anyone who is on \\n\\nthe list, please refer to that person by the number.    Thank you.   \\n\\nA.      [10:05:44] He asked me several times about number 9, and other people whose \\n\\nnames I don\\'t see them here.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:06:06] That is okay.    We can --     \\n\\nA.      [10:06:12] Number 38 was also mentioned and he asked me if that person can be \\n\\na witness.    I told him I don\\'t know if he can be a witness. \\n\\nHe also asked about -- about number 43, whether he was meeting with white people.   \\n\\nBut he also asked about the parents of number 37, whether I know them or not. \\n\\nTogether with the other persons, I think these are the ones I can recall being asked \\n\\nabout.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:07:10] Thank you, sir.    I will ask you more questions about these \\n\\nindividuals once we return to private session with the permission of the Court.    But \\n\\nfor now, I would like to ask you did you know why person number 19 was asking \\n\\nyou about all these individuals?   \\n\\nA.      [10:07:40] He wanted these people to withdraw themselves from ICC\\'s \\n\\n22.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 13 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-054-Red-ENG CT WT 22-02-2022 14/83 RH T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0341 \\n\\nwitness -- from being ICC witnesses.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:07:51] And why was he asking you about these individuals?   \\n\\nA.      [10:08:01] You know, these people, I was with them.    We shared the same \\n\\npolitical ideology, so this -- he thought I might have an influential person who can \\n\\nconvince them to withdraw themselves from being ICC witnesses.    I think that\\'s \\n\\nthe reason he expected from me. \\n\\nThere is a -- I have recalled another name, and that is number 22.    And this one, they \\n\\nlooked at this person in different means and they got him, although he was in Europe \\n\\nby then.    But they managed to get him.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:08:56] Who managed to get him?    Please use the list, we are in public \\n\\nsession.   \\n\\nA.      [10:09:07] He didn\\'t mention the name of the person who managed to get him, \\n\\nbut he generally said, \"We have managed to get him.\" \\n\\nHonourable Judge, I wanted to add something here, that most of the time this number \\n\\n19 was using us -- he is -- he was using the -- the term \"us\", not \"I\", so he was always \\n\\nreferring to a group of persons, not he himself.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:09:52] And who was part of this group of persons in your understanding?   \\n\\nA.      [10:10:06] Please can you rephrase your question.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:10:08] Yes.    You explained to us that when person 19 was speaking to you, \\n\\nhe was always referring to \"us\" and not himself.    So I want to understand who are \\n\\nthese group of people, Mr -- person 19 was referring to in your understanding?   \\n\\nA.      [10:10:40] Based on my understanding and based on my speculation, I think this \\n\\nperson was a close person to a big person in the country, so I think he was part of \\n\\nthe connection of the big person in the country so that he could create a group of \\n\\npersons to work on his behalf.   \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n22.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 14 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-054-Red-ENG CT WT 22-02-2022 15/83 RH T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0341 \\n\\nQ.      [10:11:09] All right.    I will ask you to clarify the name of the big person, if you \\n\\nknow, once we go into private session. \\n\\nLet me move on to the next question, then.    After this -- I\\'ll rephrase.    Did you know \\n\\nall the people who were mentioned to you during this meeting?    Did you know any \\n\\nof them?   \\n\\nA.

And the other person -- wait a moment, I don\\'t see -- yes, number 37, I \\n\\nknow him very well.    But I don\\'t know his home background.    He was living in \\n\\nanother county so I don\\'t have any background about his family.   \\n\\nMS ZAGO:    [10:12:41] \\n\\nQ.      [10:12:42] That is okay, sir.    Thank you.     \\n\\nAt this meeting did person 19 tell you anything else, that you recall?   \\n\\nA.      [10:12:57] I can\\'t recall some of the issues he discussed with me because there \\n\\nwere several issues.    During that -- during the meeting -- during that meeting he was \\n\\naccompanied by Mr Gicheru was the first.    But there were several other meetings \\n\\nwhich he himself came to -- to talk to us.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:13:18] And how do you -- did you feel during that meeting, during that \\n\\nmeeting or after the meeting, how did you feel about it? \\n\\nA.      [10:13:33] I felt fearful, I felt threatened, because I had already received \\n\\ninformation that he was (Redacted) so I was a bit fearful.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:13:46] Fearful or -- of what, exactly?   \\n\\nA.      [10:13:52] I was -- I was fearful of being killed.

[10:14:08] What did P -- person 19 tell you about -- about this to create this fear \\n\\nin you?   \\n\\nA.      [10:14:26] Based on the nature of the questions he asked me and as he was \\n\\ndirecting me to work -- or to participate in difficult tasks and he was insisting about \\n\\nworking on that assignment.    That\\'s why I was fearful, because many things, \\n\\nclandestine things were happening in Kenya, so that\\'s why I was -- I felt threatened. \\n\\nHonourable Judge, in other meetings I can recall -- I remember he -- he once \\n\\nthreatened us that \"I will -- I will kill you once you reveal everything that we are \\n\\ndiscussing.\"    And so that\\'s why I was fearful. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:15:16] Yes, Counsel. \\n\\nMR AOUINI:    [10:15:17] Sorry to interrupt, Madam President.    I think we are \\n\\nmoving into a section where it reveals the identity of -- of the witness from the \\n\\npersons mentioned and the substance of the interactions, so I\\'d kindly request that we \\n\\ndeal with these in private session.    Thank you. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:15:43] Mr Karnavas. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:15:44] I leave it to your wise discretion. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:15:49] Madam Prosecutor. \\n\\nMS ZAGO:    [10:15:52] I do not see the -- the -- the area of this questioning engaging \\n\\nRule 74, but I\\'m gladly going into private session if the identity of the witness is \\n\\npossibly potentially compromised. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:16:14] Counsel, my understanding is that, you \\n\\nknow, this was a meeting and there were other, a lot of other people, maybe.    It was \\n\\nnot just the witness and one person.    My concern is that, you know, you people are \\n\\nnaming names.

Thank you, Madam President. \\n\\nQUESTIONED BY MR KARNAVAS:   \\n\\nQ.      [11:32:56] Good morning, sir. \\n\\nA.      [11:33:00] I am fine.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:33:04] Good.    Now I just want to ask a few questions to make sure that I \\n\\nhave the essence of your testimony correct.    So I will -- I will try to summarise what \\n\\nwe heard from you since yesterday.    Okay?   \\n\\nA.      [11:33:28] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:33:31] You told us that you were paid slightly over 2 million Kenyan \\n\\nshillings over a period of months so as not to be a witness in the -- against William \\n\\nRuto; is that correct?   \\n\\nA.      [11:33:54] Yes.     \\n\\nQ.      [11:33:53] The money was given to you, and as I understand it, at least from one \\n\\nof your statements, there were times when (Redacted) collected some money but   \\n\\nalso you were receiving money from Mr Gicheru and from this individual, person \\n\\nnumber 19.

[11:34:52] So you told us that you were receiving money sometimes from \\n\\nMr Gicheru, sometimes from person number 19.    And in your statement -- in one of \\n\\nyour statements you indicate sometimes (Redacted) would go and pick up some \\n\\nmoney as well?   \\n\\nA.      [11:35:13] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:35:14] And yesterday -- you don\\'t have to keep staring at the numbers, sir.   \\n\\nYesterday you told us that when you first went to the meeting or when you first had \\n\\nthe conversation about the amount of money that you would be paid not to be \\n\\na witness against Mr Ruto, you had requested 5 million Kenyan shillings?   \\n\\nA.      [11:35:53] I was promised 5 million.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:35:58] Okay.    You were promised 5 million.    And I believe you were also \\n\\npromised a car, some land, (Redacted) \\n\\nis that right? \\n\\nA.      [11:36:13] Yes, yes. \\n\\nQ.      [11:36:14] All of these things were promised to you?   \\n\\nA.      [11:36:23] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:36:23] But in the end you only received 2 million.    A little bit over 2 million.   \\n\\nA.      [11:36:34] Yes, with different instalments.    I received in different instalments \\n\\nand the total came to 2 million. \\n\\nQ.      [11:36:44] Right.    Okay.    And you told us that you opened up, after the first \\n\\ninstalment, you opened up a bank account and you deposited part of that money into \\n\\n22.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 31 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-054-Red-ENG CT WT 22-02-2022 32/83 RH T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0341 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nthe bank? \\n\\nA.      [11:36:58] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:36:59] And then after that, periodically you would also deposit other \\n\\namounts of money that you were receiving from Mr Gicheru or person number 19? \\n\\nA.      [11:37:11] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:37:14] All right.    And as I understand it correctly, you had entered into \\n\\nsome sort of an agreement, and in fact it was a written agreement?   \\n\\nA.      [11:37:36] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:37:38] Initially you told us that it was a typed agreement.    It was typed out.   \\n\\nYou didn\\'t read it.    But you signed it.   \\n\\nA.      [11:37:50] Someone read it to me in English, but I don\\'t know English.    But \\n\\nthat\\'s what it was.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:37:58] So was it -- was it read to you in English, but translated into Kiswahili, \\n\\nor was it -- or did they tell you what it -- what it said in Kiswahili? \\n\\nA.      [11:38:16] The agreement was about me withdrawing myself as a witness for \\n\\nICC. \\n\\nQ.      [11:38:23] All right.    Okay.    And as I understand it, there came a time when \\n\\nthey asked you to prepare another agreement, or statement, and that one was \\n\\nhandwritten.    Maybe not by you, but someone else, but it was handwritten; is that \\n\\nright?   \\n\\nA.      [11:38:45] That came later after they were -- they feared that I was \\n\\ncommunicating with the ICC officers.    So they required me to -- to have another \\n\\nstatement which had to do that.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:39:01] Right.    And in-between this period, in-between this period when \\n\\nthey suspected that you were -- that you were still having contact with the ICC, and \\n\\n22.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 32 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-054-Red-ENG CT WT 22-02-2022 33/83 RH T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0341 \\n\\nthereafter and afterwards, they continued to give you payments, instalments of \\n\\nthe money that had been promised to you? \\n\\nA.      [11:39:25] Yes, they continued paying me.    But in the -- in the end the last \\n\\ninstalment was from the hotel which I have told you, which is number 15.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:39:43]    Right.     \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [11:39:43] Excuse me.    Excuse me, Mr Karnavas, \\n\\ncould you go at a slower pace.    Pause at least 5 seconds after the witness gives his \\n\\nanswer, so as to help the interpreters, please.    Thank you. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [11:39:57] (Microphone not activated) Okay.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:40:07] So just to make sure I understand, sir, even though, even though you \\n\\nwere not abiding by the conditions of the agreement that you had signed, they \\n\\nnonetheless continued to make payments to you? \\n\\nA.      [11:40:31] You know, Honourable Judge, many things have passed.    It has been \\n\\na long time.    Some of the issues I have forgotten.    I can\\'t recall everything.    But \\n\\nwhat I can remember is that this person number 19 was coming to me after being \\n\\ndirected by Mr Gicheru that I should meet him in places that were designated for us \\n\\nto meet.    I can\\'t recall how many times, but he came to me several times.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:41:03] And when he came to you several times, he came there for \\n\\nthe purpose of giving you instalment payments, right?    That was --   \\n\\nA.      [11:41:15] Yes, it\\'s true that there was no time that he came without payments.   \\n\\nAll the time he could give me 100,000 or some other payments.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:41:25] And just to make sure that we\\'re clear, those payments were being \\n\\nmade even after they were unhappy with you because they thought you were still \\n\\ncontinuing to be a witness for the ICC?   \\n\\nA.      [11:41:50] I think the last time after they -- they suspected me, I think it was \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n22.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 33 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-054-Red-ENG CT WT 22-02-2022 34/83 RH T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0341 \\n\\nthe meeting that I held with number 1, so they started suspecting me.    But \\n\\nthe previous ones I think they only suspected.    But they became aware of that after I \\n\\nmet with number 1. \\n\\nQ.      [11:42:12] Okay. \\n\\nJust to make sure that I understand you correctly.    You had a tête-à-tête, you -- with \\n\\nnumber 1.    You met number 1 in person and had a conversation about you receiving \\n\\npayments; is that what you\\'re telling us? \\n\\nA.      [11:42:33] I\\'m saying where I went.    No, I\\'m talking about the location number \\n\\n1.    I am talking about location number 1.    But the person number 1, I didn\\'t receive \\n\\nany money from person number 1.    I was talking about the location number 1.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:42:54] My apologies.    All right.   \\n\\nNow, as I also understand your testimony, there were times when Mr Gicheru was \\n\\ncalling you, right?   \\n\\nA.      [11:43:17] Yes, I was communicating with him many times through the phone. \\n\\nQ.      [11:43:22] Sometimes you would -- he would call you and sometimes you would \\n\\ncall him?   \\n\\nA.      [11:43:30] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:43:33] And you even told us that he was he who put his number in your \\n\\nphone under the name \"Paulo\".    We saw that this morning, right? \\n\\nA.      [11:43:45] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:43:47] Very well.    And you also tell us, in your statement at least, that you \\n\\nhad many other communications with others that were involved in this matter, other \\n\\nindividuals.    And if you look at the list of persons, I\\'ll just name a few.    So if you \\n\\ncan have that list.    So for instance, number 13, person number 13.   \\n\\nA.

I only had one shot of \\n\\nespresso, so you can imagine what two would have done. \\n\\nQ.      [11:46:42] You also had contact with person number one, right, by phone? \\n\\nA.      [11:46:49] Many times I communicated with him.    He was the representative of \\n\\nthe victims of ICC and he -- she was inviting us to the meetings that were held in \\n\\nNairobi or Nakuru. \\n\\nQ.      [11:47:06] Okay.    And of course you indicated person number 38? \\n\\nA.      [11:47:18] Yes, yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:47:19] And many others.    Including person number 44.    Do you recall \\n\\ncontacting person number 44, at least attempting to speak with to her, you calling \\n\\nperson number 44?   \\n\\nA.      [11:47:57] I don\\'t remember.    What I can remember is that we were together \\n\\nwith her during campaigns, but we never discussed about the victims or whatever \\n\\nway about the victims.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:48:16] All right.

[11:48:39] Yes.    The phone communications were there because she was \\n\\na partner in the -- in the discussions, so maybe we had some communications with \\n\\nher.    But unfortunately she didn\\'t attend any meetings of the victims.    Maybe on \\n\\nother issues I had communicated with her.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:49:06] All right.    So did I more or less capture the essence of your testimony?   \\n\\nI know you said much more, but I want to -- I want to make sure that what I\\'ve \\n\\ndescribed thus far is essentially your testimony.   \\n\\nA.      [11:49:30] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:49:32] All right.    Now help me out here.    What we can glean from your \\n\\nstatement and other evidence is that there came a time when you provided \\n\\nthe investigators with two phones, two mobile phones.    Do you recall that?   \\n\\nA.      [11:49:56] Yes, I recall.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:49:58] And when you provided them with those two phones, you only had \\n\\none SIM for them? \\n\\nA.      [11:50:11] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:50:15] You had lost the other SIM? \\n\\nA.      [11:50:19] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:50:21] The phones were provided to the investigators in order for them to \\n\\nexamine the phones to see what was in your phones and SIM card; is that right?   \\n\\nA.      [11:50:34] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:50:36] Now -- and that\\'s where that list of names comes from, as I \\n\\nunderstand it? \\n\\nA.      [11:50:44] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.

[11:51:04] I -- I wrote my statement, but they didn\\'t tell me what were the results \\n\\nof the investigation.    I don\\'t know.    If you want to explain to me in detail, you can \\n\\ntell me.    But I don\\'t recall anything.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:51:24] Well, I\\'ll -- I will explain in some detail, but I\\'ll take your word for it \\n\\nthat the Prosecutors never bothered to explain to you what was in or what was not in \\n\\nyour phone, having examined it.     \\n\\nBut in your conversations, or during your conversations with the OTP investigators \\n\\nwhen you were giving your -- your statement - and I believe you said it was three or \\n\\nfour days.    We have the dates - there were times that -- when they were asking you \\n\\nfor numbers, for you to provide them numbers of individuals that you had been in \\n\\ncontact with that you claim to have been calling.    Do you recall that?   \\n\\nA.      [11:52:09] I don\\'t recall.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:52:10] Do you recall telling the investigators that you could not remember \\n\\nthe number of, say, your son because it was in the SIM card and you no longer had \\n\\nthe SIM card that was lost?   \\n\\nA.      [11:52:32] Honourable Judge, I can\\'t recall everything that I had discussed with \\n\\nthem during that time.    I can\\'t -- it\\'s a long time, so I can\\'t recall.    I can\\'t say \\n\\nanything.    I can\\'t say that I said this and that.    It might be possible that I said or I -- I \\n\\ndidn\\'t say.    I have forgotten many issues. \\n\\nQ.      [11:52:52] All right.    And to be fair with you, I will -- to the extent that I can, I \\n\\nwill go through parts of your statement to refresh your memory or to confront you \\n\\nwith certain evidence.    But would it surprise you, sir, that from the examination of \\n\\nyour phone, the examination that was done by the experts chosen by the Prosecution, \\n\\nwe don\\'t see any calls from you to Mr Gicheru or from Mr Gicheru to you?

[11:53:42] It doesn\\'t surprise me at all.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:53:45] All right.    Now you did -- there came a time when you provided \\n\\nthe OTP, the investigators, with your bank statements.    Do you recall that?   \\n\\nA.      [11:54:05] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:54:06] In fact, there had been some confusion because initially you did not \\n\\nprovide them with the -- the right documents, but eventually you managed to get \\n\\nthem the documents that they were looking for.   \\n\\nA.      [11:54:26] Please can you rephrase your question.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:54:30] Okay.    Did they not initially ask you to bring the documents in \\n\\na sealed envelope the first time, certified, and they weren\\'t quite correct, but then later \\n\\non you managed to get them the correct documents that we saw here in court? \\n\\nA.      [11:54:53] Yes.    I came to Nairobi after I was told that the -- the documents were \\n\\nnot satisfactory.    So I had to go back and collect over additional documents. \\n\\nQ.      [11:55:06] Now from the documents that were shown to you -- help me out here, \\n\\nbecause I\\'m reading them and I don\\'t see anything in your bank statement that says \\n\\nthat that money came from either Mr Gicheru or person number 19, or somebody else.   \\n\\nIt just says that you deposited the money.    Is that fair?   \\n\\nA.      [11:55:39] They didn\\'t give me cheque, they gave me cash.    And that\\'s why it \\n\\ndoesn\\'t show who -- where the money came from, because they are giving me cash \\n\\nand not cheque. \\n\\nQ.      [11:55:53] But from your statement, how do we know that that money came \\n\\nfrom Mr Gicheru and not from one of your relatives?    Can you prove today to this \\n\\nCourt that fact? \\n\\nA.      [11:56:11] I -- I confirm in this Court that I communicated with Gicheru several \\n\\n22.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 39 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-054-Red-ENG CT WT 22-02-2022 40/83 RH T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0341 \\n\\ntimes.    And I don\\'t understand why you -- you say there were no conversations.    I \\n\\ncommunicated with him through the phone several times. \\n\\nQ.      [11:56:25] Sir, there\\'s no need to get excited.    I\\'m not suggesting you didn\\'t \\n\\ncommunicate.    I\\'m suggesting that there\\'s no record.    You\\'re claiming to do that.   \\n\\nBut I have nothing, we have nothing, the Prosecution has nothing that confirm that \\n\\nthose communications actually occurred.    That\\'s what I\\'m suggesting.    And I\\'m not \\n\\nsaying it\\'s your fault. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [11:56:49] How about the telephone log, I don\\'t know \\n\\nwhich tab that is, showing telephone calls or something that came from this person \\n\\nthat the witness described as \"Paulo\" I think?   \\n\\nMr Karnavas. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [11:57:14] Yes, we have the logs, your Honour, but we don\\'t see \\n\\nany communications.    It\\'s just a name in a log.    And I\\'m not suggesting that it\\'s not \\n\\nthere.    But we -- you know, he could have put it in himself.    And I -- if I may \\n\\nproceed, your Honour, I might be able to assist in that. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [11:57:35] Go on.    Go ahead, Mr Karnavas. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [11:57:38] \\n\\nQ.      [11:57:38] Now at some point, Mr Witness, at some point you had told us \\n\\nyesterday that you had received Mr Gicheru\\'s business card.    Do you recall that?   \\n\\nA.      [11:57:57] Which business card?   \\n\\nQ.      [11:57:59] Mr Gicheru\\'s business card.    Do you recall that?   \\n\\nA.      [11:58:10] There was a card, yes, I took from Mr Gicheru. \\n\\nQ.      [11:58:14] All right.    And on that card there are numbers, are there not? \\n\\nA.      [11:58:24] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [11:58:24] And the number that is in your mobile phone is also on the card, is it \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n22.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 40 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-054-Red-ENG CT WT 22-02-2022 41/83 RH T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0341 \\n\\nnot? \\n\\nA.      [11:58:32] I can\\'t remember to have compared the numbers, because Mr Gicheru \\n\\nhad a lot of -- had several phones with different numbers.    But the number that I \\n\\nused to communicate with him is the one he gave me.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:58:47] Okay.    We\\'ll get to that. \\n\\nConcerning the agreements, the contracts that you told us, you indicated that you did \\n\\nnot receive a copy.    In fact, you told us that you didn\\'t even read those agreements.   \\n\\nA.      [11:59:13] Yes, I didn\\'t read myself because it was written in English and I don\\'t \\n\\nknow English.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:59:20] And the agreement that you were signing was for the benefit of \\n\\nthe ICC.    You were telling the ICC you were no longer going to be a witness.   \\n\\nA.      [11:59:31] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:59:32] You were withdrawing from the ICC.   \\n\\nA.      [11:59:38] Yes.    They -- they told me that they are the ones who are going to \\n\\nsend the agreement to ICC telling them that this witness has withdrawn from being \\n\\nthe ICC witness.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:59:50] And yet we have no agreements, or none were provided from \\n\\nthe Prosecution, that we see, that you signed withdrawing as a witness against \\n\\nMr Ruto.   \\n\\nA.      [12:00:12] That\\'s what happened.    I didn\\'t make a follow up on what happened \\n\\nlater after I signed.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:00:20] And one last matter.    I mean, you indicated to us yesterday that you \\n\\nwere very vocal, very -- very public in your advocating as a victim against Mr Ruto in \\n\\nthe post-election violence.    Do you recall saying -- telling us that?   \\n\\nA.      [12:00:52] Yes, I remember I talked a lot during -- after the post-election violence.   \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n22.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 41 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-054-Red-ENG CT WT 22-02-2022 42/83 RH T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0341 \\n\\nAnd I was not the representative of the victims, but I was among the victims.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:01:05] Right.    And you told us yesterday that you talked and you were \\n\\nmaking public speeches and attending all these victims\\' meetings and being very \\n\\nvocal, all the way up until 2013; is that right?   \\n\\nA.      [12:01:27] It is -- it is up to 2014.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:01:31] 2014.    And in fact in your statement you say that you were even on \\n\\ntelevision.   \\n\\nA.      [12:01:41] Yes.    Even to radio.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:01:45] All right.    And yet the only thing that we really have that was \\n\\nproduced by the Prosecution, other than what we saw today where I don\\'t -- and I \\n\\nmight be mistaken, I don\\'t see your name on it.    And it might be for -- for good \\n\\nreasons, but the only thing that we have thus far is an article that was dated in 2009 \\n\\nwhere we see your picture and we see your name.    Nothing in 2010, nothing - relax, \\n\\nI\\'m not going to mention any names - 2011, 2012 or 2013, or even 2014.    We don\\'t see \\n\\nany of that.   \\n\\nA.      [12:02:39] Some things, it\\'s not necessary to say them.    Maybe it cannot be \\n\\nwritten these things on all newspapers, but as far as I\\'m concerned I attended many, \\n\\nmany meetings. \\n\\nQ.      [12:02:52] Okay.    And all we have, at the end of the day, all we have is what \\n\\nyou tell us.   \\n\\nA.      [12:03:06] I don\\'t know.    Can you maybe explain.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:03:09] Well, as I tried to say earlier, you talk about having all these telephone \\n\\nconversations but we have no records, so all we have is your word.   \\n\\nA.      [12:03:33] I could not do the follow up of the records, but I know that I \\n\\ncommunicated with Mr Gicheru not once, many times.   \\n\\n22.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 42 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-054-Red-ENG CT WT 22-02-2022 43/83 RH T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0341 \\n\\nQ.      [12:03:43] You\\'ve told us that you were in the news, in the newspapers, on \\n\\ntelevision, on radio.    But all we have is one article and nothing other than your word.   \\n\\nA.      [12:04:04] Your Honour, the newspapers, that\\'s just a part of that.    But we have \\n\\nso many things.    I could not even buy all the newspapers.    Sometimes I was told \\n\\nthat you appeared, you featured in the newspaper, but I could not buy \\n\\nthe newspapers because I live in a remote area.    I don\\'t come to town to buy \\n\\nnewspapers. \\n\\nYour Honour, many newspapers in Kenya are written in English.    Very few \\n\\nnewspapers are in Kiswahili, and when I go out I just buy newspapers in Kiswahili.   \\n\\nI could not read many newspapers.    Even the Guardian, I did not read it. \\n\\nQ.      [12:04:54] Sir, just to be clear, I\\'m not being very critical.    You shouldn\\'t have to \\n\\ngo and gather all of these articles and footage from TV or radio, that\\'s the job for \\n\\nthe Prosecution.    So don\\'t -- don\\'t be alarmed.     \\n\\nBut again, all we have is your word when you say that you wrote some contracts.   \\n\\nWe don\\'t have them physically, so we have to take your word, right?   \\n\\nA.      [12:05:37] Could you please repeat that question.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:05:41] I apologise.    I\\'m trying to speed it up, but I\\'ll try to be simpler.     \\n\\nWhen you tell us that you signed agreements and contracts not to be a witness against \\n\\nRuto, we don\\'t have them, we can\\'t find them, the Prosecution hasn\\'t produced them.   \\n\\nSo all we have is your word that you actually signed those contracts, right?   \\n\\nA.      [12:06:14] Yes, I remember that I signed an agreement to -- to be removed as \\n\\na witness.    But that document was left with Mr Gicheru.    I didn\\'t have a copy that I \\n\\ncould give to the investigators of ICC, because he didn\\'t give me the copy.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:06:39] And the deposits that are -- that we saw from your bank statements, \\n\\nagain, all we have is your word that the money that you were depositing came from \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n22.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 43 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-054-Red-ENG CT WT 22-02-2022 44/83 RH T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0341 \\n\\nMr Gicheru or number 19, based on this agreement of yours.   \\n\\nA.

[12:07:27] And what I\\'m saying is all we have is your word where the money \\n\\ncame from.    We have nothing concrete, nothing tangible to support your word.    So \\n\\nyou\\'re asking us to simply take your word.   \\n\\nA.      [12:07:53] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:07:54] Okay.    Thank you. \\n\\nNow I want to move to another topic.    So we\\'re going to go back in time.    The time \\n\\nis 2011.    In 2011 you made an application to become a victim.    Do you recall that?   \\n\\nA.      [12:08:25] I recall I applied a lot of time to become a victim.    But I can\\'t \\n\\nremember at what time, but I remember that I made a lot of applications.   \\n\\nQ.

I hope we got it right.       \\n\\nQ.      [14:35:18] So before -- well, let me just ask this question, sir, so we can -- we can \\n\\nfinish up early. \\n\\nSir, when -- when you were being prepared to testify by the Prosecution team, do you \\n\\nrecall saying then, this is in 2022, that back in 2012 is when you were provided \\n\\na phone?    Something that you have told us earlier today.    Do you recall that?    It\\'s \\n\\non page 4 of this document. \\n\\nA.      [14:36:19] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:36:20] Yeah.    And that\\'s where you say that they gave you a phone so you \\n\\ncould communicate to schedule a full interview later, right?   \\n\\nA.      [14:36:39] I was given an ordinary telephone, and I saw that it was good.    Then \\n\\nI used my line to use it.    They didn\\'t tell me how we are going to communicate.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:36:53] Okay.    Does that mean that they didn\\'t even give you a number, \\n\\ntelephone number to communicate with them?    They just gave you a phone?    No \\n\\nSIM card?   \\n\\nA.      [14:37:10] I was not given a SIM card.    I was not given any number to \\n\\ncommunicate with them.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:37:16] So, if I understand correctly, and I\\'m not -- I know it\\'s -- we\\'re going \\n\\n22.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 63 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-054-Red-ENG CT WT 22-02-2022 64/83 RH T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0341 \\n\\nback 10 years now.    They just said, \"Here\\'s a phone.    Next time we\\'ll be able to \\n\\ncommunicate better.\"   \\n\\nA.      [14:37:35] Your Honour, after our meeting, as I told you, we did not have an \\n\\ninterpreter, but when we parted our ways, when I left to -- when I left Nairobi, that\\'s \\n\\nwhen they gave me that phone without any explanation.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:37:58] And at some point you put your own SIM card in it and began using \\n\\nit for your -- your own purposes, right?   \\n\\nA.      [14:38:10] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:38:11] Okay.    All right.    Now, if -- from my -- from the documents that I\\'ve \\n\\nreceived from the Prosecution, it would appear that the next time that you are \\n\\ncommunicating with the Office of the Prosecution of the International Criminal Court \\n\\nis in 2014. \\n\\nSo if we could look at tab 2, 014 -- 0147-2132.    Tab 2.    And here it says -- we have \\n\\na message that is being sent on 24 March 2014 where apparently you contacted \\n\\nsomeone by the name of (Redacted), and you passed on certain information to that \\n\\nindividual to pass on to the ICC.    Am I getting it right? \\n\\nA.      [14:39:46] I remember (Redacted).    It was not only him.    We -- I   \\n\\ncommunicated with a number of people, your Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [14:39:55] I -- I understand that.    But all I have here is this document, and we\\'re \\n\\ngoing to get to what was shown to you earlier by the Prosecutor.    But in March 2024 \\n\\nyou reached out.   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [14:40:10] Mindful that names are being mentioned, \\n\\nMr Karnavas. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [14:40:16] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.

[14:40:27] I communicated with Mr (Redacted) a number of times so that   \\n\\nhe can convey my messages to the Prosecutor.    But it was not only once.    It was \\n\\na number of times.

And that is, the witness was proofed over a period of 17 hours, \\n\\nfrom 17 or 19 February 2022, 17 hours.    The proofing session ended on Saturday at \\n\\n1.10 p.m., Saturday afternoon.    I received the Prosecution\\'s request on a Sunday right \\n\\nbefore 5 p.m.     \\n\\nNow, I don\\'t want to scribe any bad intentions, but I find it rather unbecoming and \\n\\n21.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 2 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-053-Red-ENG WT 21-02-2022 3/91 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                  (Open Session)                                                    ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\ncertainly disquieting that I would be receiving this request and that you would be \\n\\nreceiving this request on a Sunday afternoon, for the following reasons:     \\n\\nOne, the Court, this Chamber, has been rather generous and flexible to the parties in \\n\\nallowing them to communicate with the Chamber via email.     \\n\\nSecondly, a 10-page submission was totally unnecessary when a two or a three cogent \\n\\nparagraph in an email would have sufficed. \\n\\nThird, and more importantly - and, granted, my learned colleague may not be as \\n\\nexperienced - but within a matter of an hour or two, or a day, or maybe even two \\n\\ndays, one would come to the conclusion that this witness has some special needs and, \\n\\ntherefore, should communicate it to the Chamber and to the parties as quickly as \\n\\npossible. \\n\\nMight I also add that this witness was previously interviewed, 13 March 2021.   \\n\\nGranted, this was not an in-person interview.    But even at that point in time, they \\n\\nwould have realised that perhaps this particular witness, you know, had \\n\\nsome -- some shortcomings, if you will, and therefore, they could have availed \\n\\nthemselves to the route of Rule 68(3).    They chose not to, but we\\'re going to get to \\n\\nthat.     \\n\\nBut my point is this:    This trial is a sprint, is very short, it\\'s very intense.    The stakes \\n\\nmay not be as high as in a -- in an Article 5 case, but for Mr Gicheru, this is a \\n\\nmomentous occasion because his liberty is at stake, his professional license is at stake.   \\n\\nAnd, therefore, he wants to have a fair trial.     \\n\\nI don\\'t think it should take too much effort for the Prosecution to -- if they find \\n\\nthemselves in these situations, to simply communicate to the parties and to the \\n\\nChamber as quickly as possible.    I\\'m sure your staff, who is hardworking and very \\n\\nefficient, should not be disturbed on a Sunday afternoon.    Maybe they\\'re used to it \\n\\n21.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 3 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-053-Red-ENG WT 21-02-2022 4/91 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                  (Open Session)                                                    ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nfrom other cases, but I don\\'t think it\\'s necessary.    We have enough stress.    We don\\'t \\n\\nneed to create more stress. \\n\\nSo, I invite -- on this particular point, I invite the Chamber to at least give us a \\n\\ncautionary instruction that, in the future, feel free to make a brief, cogent submission \\n\\nby email, as was done -- and the very last time it was done, by the way, your Honour, \\n\\nwas on 31 January 2022, when they submitted a two-page, a two-page email making a \\n\\nrequest.    It was a -- it was a rather substantial request.    And her Honour indicated, \\n\\n\"Okay.    We\\'ll shorten the time for a response.    And if you will, Defence, you can \\n\\nrespond by email in kind.\"    And it was handled in that fashion.    And I very much \\n\\nappreciate that because there\\'s no need to write lengthy submissions. \\n\\nAnd might I also inform the Prosecution that there is such a thing as cut and paste, \\n\\ncut and paste.    You know, we\\'re in that -- you know, when I started, we didn\\'t have \\n\\nthat.    But now we have this -- the ability to produce a document by cutting and \\n\\npasting, and this would have taken about approximately one or two hours to make \\n\\nthis submission.    It should not have taken a day and a half, even if, even if it dawned \\n\\non them, after the conclusion of 17 hours of meeting with the gentleman, that he had \\n\\nsome special needs. \\n\\nSo that\\'s my opening salvo.    Now let me get to the substance. \\n\\nThis is not a situation where I need to go nuclear.    It\\'s a simple request.    It\\'s a \\n\\nreasonable request, you could say.    The Rules allow it.    There is one pesky issue, \\n\\nand that is, they missed the deadline.    They missed the deadline.     \\n\\nNow, the judges in this tribunal, and in other tribunals, have wide discretion, and \\n\\nthey don\\'t want to punish either party or -- especially the witnesses or the victims or \\n\\nthe -- or the accused by holding firm to certain deadlines when it\\'s not a \\n\\nmake-or-break situation.    And this is not one of them.    This is not one of them.   \\n\\n21.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 4 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-053-Red-ENG WT 21-02-2022 5/91 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                  (Open Session)                                                    ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nAnd the temptation would be, the temptation would be to say:    Well, okay, no harm, \\n\\nno foul.    Why don\\'t we just go ahead and allow the Prosecution to go forward as it \\n\\nwishes.   \\n\\nAnd were this request made before the deadline, to be very honest, very frank, I \\n\\nprobably would have said, I\\'ll leave it to the Court\\'s discretion, as I\\'ve done on many, \\n\\nmany occasions.    I\\'m an easy kind of guy, you know.    I think it\\'s -- I\\'ve proved that \\n\\nI\\'m pretty easy to get along with. \\n\\nNow, unfortunately, they didn\\'t do that.    So now they come, like Oliver Twist, cup in \\n\\nhand, and they say, \"Oh, please, give us this opportunity to avail ourselves to \\n\\nRule 68(3).\"    And what are the reasons?    What are the reasons?    And those reasons \\n\\ncan be found on paragraph 4 of their submission.     \\n\\nAnd I looked at them again today.    And, frankly, I didn\\'t give this much thought last \\n\\nnight because what can I do on a Sunday night?    But this morning I looked at it with \\n\\nclear eyes, and I kind of pondered over paragraph 4.    And what are the excuses that \\n\\nare -- that they\\'re providing?    And it\\'s almost like, a dog ate my, you know, \\n\\nhomework, sort of excuse.   \\n\\nThe age.    Is this something that they discovered, you know, on a Sunday night, his \\n\\nage?    No.     \\n\\nHis education level.    Is this the first time that they discovered his educational level?   \\n\\nThey spoke to him.    The last time it was in March 2021, and they met with him on \\n\\n2015.    So they would have known that the gentleman had the education level that he \\n\\nhad. \\n\\nThe language requirements.    Well, how on God\\'s earth did the investigators \\n\\ncommunicate with this gentleman before?    Through language assistants, unless the \\n\\ninvestigators spoke Swahili.    And to my understanding, they did not.    So, obviously, \\n\\n21.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 5 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-053-Red-ENG WT 21-02-2022 6/91 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                  (Open Session)                                                    ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nthat wasn\\'t a newsflash for them. \\n\\nThen they talk about his background.    Well, I don\\'t understand what that means, his \\n\\nbackground, how that factors in.    And they say that he\\'s required slow and \\n\\nmethodical questioning and assistance to pursue documents and images.     \\n\\nNow, if they had this communication with the gentleman, with him being country X, \\n\\nand those questioning him in The Hague would - and, mind you, it\\'s not \\n\\nperson-to-person - those challenges would have become readily apparent to them.   \\n\\nAnd then they say, well, even documents in Swahili, you know, he would take a long \\n\\ntime to go through, and then there is this -- the PIL that we have to use in this case, \\n\\nand so that complicates matters and would slow the proceedings down. \\n\\nAnd then, lastly, he (Redacted).    And, incidentally, I have (Redacted),   \\n\\nbut you don\\'t see me complaining.    I soldier through.    (Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted).    I totally understand that.    That\\'s why you see me   \\n\\npacing -- well, when you\\'re not -- we\\'re not in session. \\n\\nBut the long and short of it is, unless the gentleman is perfectly capable of following \\n\\nthe proceedings, answering questions, there\\'s no compelling reason to grant this \\n\\nmotion.    No compelling reason.     \\n\\nAnd why is that?    They say, well, initially we had projected 4.5 hours and -- that\\'s \\n\\nwhat they initially projected.    Though, in the submission -- and I have to call on my \\n\\ncolleague.    I hesitate to do this.    I really don\\'t like pointing out what I consider sort \\n\\nof sneaky -- a sneaky way of putting it.    They say, paragraph 23, \"The Prosecution \\n\\nestimates that, should the application be granted, it would require one and a half \\n\\nhours to conduct its direct examination of the witness, instead at -- instead of at least \\n\\n4.5 hours, as originally anticipated.\"     \\n\\nThey never said \"at least\".    Now, maybe in the -- in the world of the Prosecution, \"at \\n\\n21.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 6 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-053-Red-ENG WT 21-02-2022 7/91 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                  (Open Session)                                                    ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nleast\" is to be assumed.    In my world, they say 4.5, 4.5.    They didn\\'t say, well, give \\n\\nus at least this amount, but we may require more.   \\n\\nNow they say -- now it\\'s going to -- it\\'s likely to be significantly longer.    How \\n\\nsignificantly longer might it be?    One hour?    Two hours?    I don\\'t know.     \\n\\nBut what are they saying?    We can save a total of three hours, three hours.    And \\n\\nthat would be so expeditious, so efficient, you know, that when you put it on the \\n\\nbalancing scale, well, it warrants granting the request because, after all, it won\\'t be \\n\\nprejudicial to the Defence.     \\n\\nAnd here\\'s my -- my problem with all of this:    Now that they\\'ve set it out this way, if \\n\\nthe gentleman is going to have a hard time on direct examination, on direct \\n\\nexamination, where he\\'s been schooled for 17 hours on how to answer questions and \\n\\nwhat questions are going to be posed to him and what documents to look at, and \\n\\nwhat have you, because that\\'s the process, nothing that they\\'re going to show him is \\n\\ngoing to be a first instance, like perhaps the Defence.    He\\'s going to be asked in a \\n\\nvery friendly manner.    Not that I\\'m going to be unfriendly with the gentleman.    But \\n\\nif he\\'s incapable of doing direct examination as they had planned, and now they say, \\n\\nwell, let me ask just a few questions, 1.5 hours, when, frankly, it should take one \\n\\nminute or two minutes to say:    Do you recognise these documents?    Do you agree \\n\\nthat we admit them?    Yes.    Okay.    Fine.    That\\'s my direct examination.    Were \\n\\nthey to do that, I might say, you know, that\\'s a savings of time.    But they want to \\n\\nhave their cake and eat it too. \\n\\nBut if the gentleman cannot follow their direct examination, how on God\\'s earth is he \\n\\ngoing to follow cross-examination?    And then, am I going to be getting all sorts of \\n\\nobjections that I\\'m being unfair to the witness when I\\'m being -- when I\\'m pointing \\n\\nhim to certain documents and I\\'m demanding that an answer be given?    And, \\n\\n21.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 7 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-053-Red-ENG WT 21-02-2022 8/91 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                  (Open Session)                                                    ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\ngranted, style matters.    I understand that.    And hopefully you will note that it\\'s not \\n\\na -- I\\'m not a one-speed kind of guy.    I\\'m not going to do a New York-style \\n\\ncross-examination on this gentleman.    So I\\'ll be soft, I\\'ll be gentle, but I will be \\n\\npersistent.    And that\\'s my problem.   \\n\\nI see this as a pretext, in a sense.    And not -- and I\\'m not saying this, you know, that \\n\\nthere is bad faith.    But there\\'s -- in some ways, it is a pretext to circumvent \\n\\nMr Gicheru\\'s right to a full, fair and robust, and robust confrontation, \\n\\ncross-examination of this witness, as he\\'s entitled to under the Statute. \\n\\nNow, having said all of that, having said all of that, in anticipating that you are in a \\n\\nposition to most likely lean in favour towards the witness, because he\\'s old and \\n\\nbecause this is not, as I said, sort of a make-or-break situation and there is a remedy, \\n\\nthat if you are to grant the Prosecution\\'s request, then we would submit, considering \\n\\nthat we received the request so late and considering that I would have prepared the \\n\\ncross differently -- and mind you, I was preparing when I received this.     \\n\\nNow, you might say, \"Well, you know, Mr Karnavas, you\\'re an experienced lawyer.   \\n\\nAnd if you were in the state or federal court in the United States, you would get no \\n\\nsympathy from your judges.\"    And you would be absolutely right.    The judge \\n\\nwould say, \"Cry me a river.    Proceed.\"    That\\'s how we do it there.    But, again, over \\n\\nthere, we don\\'t have these rules where they say, okay, now you can bring in all these \\n\\ndocuments and consider it direct examination.    So there is that.     \\n\\nSo we would say, if you are going to grant this request, that you allow us to proceed \\n\\ntomorrow with our cross-examination, especially if the gentleman can only sit for \\n\\ncertain periods of time.     \\n\\nAnd, also, my request would be that, if I need to go into the following day -- and I\\'m \\n\\nnot saying I will.    I\\'m not saying I need it.    Originally, I had projected two sessions, \\n\\n21.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 8 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-053-Red-ENG WT 21-02-2022 9/91 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                  (Open Session)                                                    ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nto be - you know, full disclosure - with this gentleman.    That\\'s how I projected it.    I \\n\\nmight need three.    I might need four.    I don\\'t know if we need to.    I\\'m perfectly \\n\\nwilling take, you know, periodic breaks to accommodate the gentleman.    And I can \\n\\nassure you, I will try my utmost to be as considerate and as gentle with the -- with the \\n\\nwitness.     \\n\\nBut my first -- my first position would be, I think that there are no compelling reasons \\n\\nto deviate from their decision.    They chose not to avail themselves of the rule.    They \\n\\nknew in advance.    And so -- but I understand that we have a gentleman with some \\n\\nparticular shortcomings.     \\n\\nSo, as I said, my first reaction, my first position is reject it.    We can go slower.    It\\'s \\n\\nnot that much of a savings.    However, I do understand that it is not so highly \\n\\nprejudicial to the Defence that somehow it would be a point on appeal were I to say, \\n\\nwell, gee, my client was denied his right to a fair trial because in this one instance we \\n\\ndeviated from what I would call more or less an artificial deadline, but nonetheless, \\n\\nall deadlines are essential.     \\n\\nAnd those are my submissions, your Honour.

This reason is fully in its control.    This alone would be reason enough \\n\\nto reject the request.    However, the Chamber has also considered the motivation for \\n\\nthe request.     \\n\\nThe Prosecution now claims that the testimony of the witness would, upon its new \\n\\nestimation, take 9 hours.    It further submits that with the introduction of P-0341\\'s \\n\\nprior recorded statements, the time of examination would be only one and a half \\n\\nhours.     \\n\\nWhile the shortening of the examination time would be indeed considerable, the \\n\\nChamber considers that an authorisation to introduce the statements at this point in \\n\\ntime would not be fair to the Defence.    The Defence prepared on the assumption that \\n\\nthe witness would provide all his evidence directly in court.     \\n\\nAn introduction via Rule 68(3) requires an adaption and review on what questions to \\n\\nput to the witness and how to structure the questioning of the witness by the Defence.   \\n\\nThis is simply not possible at this late point in time. \\n\\nSo, for these reasons, the Chamber finds that an introduction of the evidence via \\n\\nRule 68(3) would be prejudicial to the Defence and inconsistent with the rights of the \\n\\naccused, unlike claimed by the Prosecution.    Accordingly, the Chamber rejects the \\n\\nrequest.     \\n\\nSo this concludes the oral decision of the Chamber.   \\n\\nThe Prosecution -- yes, Madam Prosecutor. \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n21.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 11 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-053-Red-ENG WT 21-02-2022 12/91 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                (Private Session)                                                    ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nMS ZAGO:    [10:03:41] I was just standing because you addressed me.    Thank you. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:03:46] Thank you very much. \\n\\nThe Prosecution is now calling Witness P-0341 as its second witness.    At the outset, I \\n\\nwish to note for the parties, it is the Chamber\\'s understanding that this witness will be \\n\\ntestifying in Swahili.    I would, therefore, remind everyone of the importance of the \\n\\nneed to speak slowly for the interpreters, Mr Karnavas, and to observe the \\n\\nfive-second rule between questions and answers. \\n\\nNow, before commencing, the Chamber notes briefly that protective measures are \\n\\nconfirmed to this witness by virtue of decision 276 and that the VWU recommends no \\n\\nfurther protective measures.   \\n\\nSo I will now discuss the issue of Rule 74 assurances.    Counsel for the witness, pay \\n\\nattention -- no, because you were on your legs before I left, so I\\'m addressing that \\n\\nsection now.    You may sit down.     \\n\\nWill the court officer please move into private session for that. \\n\\n(Private session at 10.05 a.m.) \\n\\nTHE COURT OFFICER:    [10:05:31] We are in private session, Madam President. \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n(Redacted) \\n\\n21.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 12 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cTrial Hearing                                                (Private Session)                                                    ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-053-Red-ENG WT 21-02-2022 13/91 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nPage redacted – Private session. \\n\\n21.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 13 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cTrial Hearing                                                (Private Session)                                                    ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-053-Red-ENG WT 21-02-2022 14/91 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Redacted) \\n\\n  (Open session at 10.11 a.m.) \\n\\nTHE COURT OFFICER:    [10:11:05] We are back in open session, Madam President.   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:11:08] Thank you very much. \\n\\nThe Chamber will now render its decision on the requested assurances in accordance \\n\\nwith Rule 74 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.   \\n\\nMindful of the factors specified in Rule 74(5) of the Rules, the Chamber has decided to \\n\\nprovide assurances pursuant to Rule 74 of the Rules in order to enable the witness to \\n\\n21.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 14 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-053-Red-ENG WT 21-02-2022 15/91 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                (Open Session)                                                    ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS:    KEN-OTP-P-0341 \\n\\ntestify without fear of the consequence of self-incrimination.     \\n\\nThe Chamber notes the additional request by Mr Aouini regarding protective \\n\\nmeasures.

The \\n\\none in English and one in Swahili, I suppose, before the witness.    Do you want to \\n\\nconfirm with the witness which one he is using? \\n\\nMS ZAGO:    [10:29:14] Certain, your Honour.    Thank you.    I understood that the \\n\\nwitness only had Swahili, but I will certainly confirm with you.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:29:23] Sir, could you please look at the form that you have, you\\'re perusing \\n\\nright now, and can you confirm to the Court whether the form you\\'re looking at is in \\n\\nSwahili right now.   \\n\\nA.      [10:29:42] Yes, I confirm the document I have in Kiswahili language. \\n\\nQ.      [10:29:48] Just to be sure that you are not further confused, do you have a \\n\\nsecond form in English as well?    Or you only have one in Swahili? \\n\\nA.      [10:30:03] I only have a Swahili document.    I don\\'t have an English document. \\n\\nQ.      [10:30:08] Thank you, sir. \\n\\nIf you please can go to page 2 of this document that you have.    Can you see at the \\n\\ntop of the page, there is a word that says \"locations\".   \\n\\nA.      [10:30:34] Yes, I see.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:30:36] And it is followed by numbers, starting with 1, following 2, 3, all the \\n\\nway down to number 23.    Do you see that? \\n\\nA.      [10:30:51] Yes, I see it.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:30:56] These are all locations that if you need to refer in your answers when \\n\\nwe are in public session, you will refer to by location number.

Indeed I intended to clarify this \\n\\nportion.    I was hesitant to reply because the unedited transcripts, the number of \\n\\npages that I have have changed, so I was trying to locate the precise passages your \\n\\nHonour was referring to.    But that was intended to be clarified.    Thank you,   \\n\\nyour Honour.   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [14:34:31] So thank you very much.    Carry on, please, \\n\\nif you can seek the clarification of the witness.   \\n\\nMS ZAGO:    [14:34:39] Thank you.    Can I seek clarification whether we\\'re in private \\n\\nor public? \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [14:34:47] For now we are in public session, please.   \\n\\nMS ZAGO:    [14:34:53] \\n\\nQ.      [14:34:55] Sir, good afternoon.    We\\'re back in public session, and before we had \\n\\nthe break, you mentioned some money that was given to you and we need to clarify \\n\\nexactly the amount.   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [14:35:19] Did he say money that was given to him?   \\n\\nI think the money that was given to him was clear.    The other one that the interpreter \\n\\nseemed to have some problems with was some bigger amount of money.   \\n\\nMS ZAGO:    [14:35:37] Yes, your Honour.    I\\'m reading from the transcript here and \\n\\nI can quote the witness\\'s answer so that we understand what we\\'re seeking a \\n\\n21.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 64 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-053-Red-ENG WT 21-02-2022 65/91 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                (Open Session)                                                    ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0341 \\n\\nclarification on. \\n\\nI\\'m quoting:    \"I think after -- it was after receiving something from Ruto, because that \\n\\nday when I went there, I was given\" and on my transcript I have 500,000 and then \\n\\nthere is an interruption by the interpreter.     \\n\\nPerhaps we can simply put the question again to the witness.   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [14:36:24] You may do that.    It\\'s your witness.    Be \\n\\nmindful that we\\'re in open session.   \\n\\nMS ZAGO:    [14:36:31] Yes, your Honour.    Thank you. \\n\\nQ.      [14:36:35] Sir, before we had a break this morning, you told us that at that \\n\\nmeeting that we discussed that you attended, you were given a certain amount of \\n\\nmoney.    Can you please confirm the amount for us.   \\n\\nA.      [14:37:15] Before I was given that money, we had discussions, and in fact the \\n\\ndiscussion was about what type of the support.    We agreed on (Redacted)   \\n\\n(Redacted).    But for   \\n\\nthe first day I was given 500,000 Tanzanian -- Kenyan shillings, 500,000 Kenyan \\n\\nshillings.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:37:55] Thank you.    When you were given that money, were you told why \\n\\nthat money was being given to you? \\n\\nA.      [14:38:12] That money was given after I agreed that I will withdraw myself as \\n\\nthe ICC witness.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:38:30] And what did you do with that money? \\n\\nA.      [14:38:41] I went -- I deposited the same day, I deposited the money into my \\n\\nbank account.    300,000 I deposited it into my account.    But the remaining amount, I \\n\\njust took it back home for my spending.   \\n\\nYour Honour, before I got the money, we had signed a contract.

[14:39:55] Thank you, sir.     \\n\\nI would like us to understand you clearly, and I apologise if I repeat the question, but \\n\\nit is important that we understand the chronology accurately.   \\n\\nAt the meeting that we discussed earlier this morning, and I can quote from the \\n\\ntranscript in a moment, but to gain time, you mention that person number 39 on your \\n\\nlist gave you 10,000 Kenyan shillings.   \\n\\nA.      [14:41:01] Yes, for the first time when I entered the office, that person number 30 \\n\\nis the one who gave me 10,000 for lunch and transport.    But other issues were \\n\\ndirected ...   \\n\\nTHE INTERPRETER:    [14:41:28] He\\'s looking for the names.   \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [14:41:59](Interpretation) After I received 10,000 Kenyan shillings, \\n\\nhe pointed a finger to number 23, name number 23, that I should explain everything \\n\\nto him because he\\'s the focal person, he is the central person for -- I don\\'t see the \\n\\nperson in the list.

[14:52:17] Sir, we are back in public session.    I ask you to have this list in front \\n\\nof you so that we can use it.    And I wanted to ask you a clarification about what you \\n\\njust told the Court about the -- you asking for a certain amount of money to the \\n\\nindividuals you were meeting on the first meeting that you had with Mr Gicheru.   \\n\\nA.      [14:53:07] Please repeat the question.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:53:10] You mentioned -- you just told us that you requested five million \\n\\nshillings, and what we wanted to understand clearly is whether you asked for that \\n\\namount of money at that meeting or at any other time? \\n\\nA.      [14:53:41] During that meeting, it was just for introduction and that\\'s -- and \\n\\nthat\\'s why they began with 500,000 and -- but the issues that we were discussing, it \\n\\nwas -- first of all, it\\'s about knowing each other.    I started with the higher amount \\n\\nand they started with 500,000.    So it was about negotiations.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:54:11] And this negotiation, did it happen at the meeting, the first meeting \\n\\nthat you had with Mr Gicheru and other individuals? \\n\\nA.      [14:54:24] We were only two, me and Mr Gicheru, and that was another day, not \\n\\nthe first meeting. \\n\\nQ.      [14:54:32] Thank you for the clarification.   \\n\\nNow, let me ask you the following:    You told us before that Gicheru at that first \\n\\n21.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 70 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-053-Red-ENG WT 21-02-2022 71/91 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                (Open Session)                                                    ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0341 \\n\\nmeeting you had told you to come back three days later to (Redacted).   \\n\\nA.      [14:54:55] Yes.    However, I can\\'t recall very well whether it was the same day \\n\\nbecause there were some times I could go there, he could give me another day to \\n\\ncome back.    And it reached a point we now had to sign an agreement and I gave him \\n\\nmy identity card and he went to another advocate, he prepared the contract.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:55:32] So I understand from what you\\'re telling us that you have met \\n\\nMr Gicheru on several occasions? \\n\\nA.      [14:55:44] Yes, it\\'s true.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:55:47] And apart from going to (Redacted), is there any other way you could \\n\\nreach out or speak to or meet Mr Gicheru? \\n\\nA.      [14:56:07] After going to (Redacted)several times, he told me that instead of   \\n\\ncoming to (Redacted) frequently, just call me through the phone.    So I gave him my   \\n\\nnumbers and he -- I gave him my phone and he saved his number with the name of \\n\\nPaulo.    So we communicated -- I communicated with him several times through the \\n\\nphones.    So most of the time our communications were through the phones. \\n\\nQ.      [14:56:38] Sir, I know that a long time has passed, but do you remember what \\n\\ntype of phone was the one you used? \\n\\nA.      [14:56:51] That phone is a Nokia brand.    It\\'s a small -- it\\'s not a smart phone, \\n\\nbut a small phone.    I\\'m not using smart phone for internet, I\\'m using this small \\n\\nphone with a Nokia brand. \\n\\nQ.      [14:57:09] Do you still have that phone with you? \\n\\nA.      [14:57:17] I submitted the phone to the ICC Prosecutors or investigators.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:57:24] Thank you, sir. \\n\\nLet me show you a document.

Sorry.   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [14:59:11] Carry on, Madam Prosecutor.    Your mic is \\n\\noff, please. \\n\\nMS ZAGO:    [14:59:17] \\n\\nQ.      [14:59:19] Sir, you had a chance to look at this document, correct? \\n\\nA.      [14:59:23] Yes, I have gone through it.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:59:27] Do you recognise it? \\n\\nA.      [14:59:31] Yes, I recognise it.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:59:33] Can you tell the Court what that is? \\n\\nA.      [14:59:42] What I see here is a phone.    There are two phones, there\\'s one is \\n\\nNokia and the other one is Samsung.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:59:59] Is this Nokia phone similar to the one you referred to before? \\n\\nA.      [15:00:10] Yes, they -- it looks similar and I used it so often for the \\n\\ncommunications between me and Mr Gicheru.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:00:25] Thank you, sir.   \\n\\nDid you use any other device to communicate with Mr Gicheru at that time? \\n\\n21.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 72 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-053-Red-ENG WT 21-02-2022 73/91 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                (Open Session)                                                    ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0341 \\n\\nA.      [15:00:41] I don\\'t recall, but it might be possible.    There were times during \\n\\nthe -- I was -- I was alerted that people are tracking your communications with \\n\\nthe -- with the investigators.    So sometimes it might happen that I could have \\n\\nabandoned the phone and changed to another phone, but I don\\'t recall perfectly what \\n\\nhappened.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:01:12] And, sir, if I can direct your attention to the document, this document \\n\\nthat I just referred to, can you look at it, please.    The second page.    Do you see that \\n\\nat the bottom of the page there is a signature? \\n\\nA.      [15:01:38] Yes, yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:01:41] Whose signature is that? \\n\\nA.      [15:01:44] It\\'s my signature. \\n\\nQ.      [15:01:46] Thank you, sir.   \\n\\nNow, going back to the negotiations that you mentioned before, could you help us \\n\\nunderstand how long after the first meeting you had with Mr Gicheru, when -- how \\n\\nlong after you had the first meeting with Mr Gicheru did you have the negotiations \\n\\nthat you referred to before?    It was -- was it a week?    Was it a month?    Was it a \\n\\nyear?    Can you give us any indication? \\n\\nA.      [15:02:37] I can\\'t remember, but it can\\'t -- no, it cannot be one month or a week.   \\n\\nMaybe, I think it was the statement that was taken to Mr William Ruto so that he can \\n\\naccept, and I think that maybe he accepted, but other things I have forgotten. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:03:05] Just a moment, Madam Prosecutor.     \\n\\nCan the lady from VWU, can you use your mask, please, your face mask.

Can you explain to us what you mean by \"statement\" that \\n\\nwas taken to Mr William Ruto.   \\n\\nA.      [15:03:50] According to me, I told them that I wanted at least five million, but \\n\\nI was told that he said two million and he accepted two million and other things like a \\n\\ncar, a farm (Redacted).    And I was told that he had accepted all   \\n\\nthose things.    This is what I was told by Mr Gicheru.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:04:24] So let\\'s understand well your answer.    You were told by Mr Gicheru \\n\\nthat someone had accepted all the things that you had requested.    Who is that \\n\\nperson? \\n\\nA.      [15:04:54] The one who accepted two million and all the other things, it is \\n\\nHonourable William Ruto who accepted to give me that.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:05:08] Thank you, sir. \\n\\nAnd earlier in your evidence today, this afternoon, you mentioned that you signed a \\n\\ncontract, and I\\'d like you to explain to the Court what you mean by \"contract\" in this \\n\\ncontext.   \\n\\nA.      [15:05:34] You are talking about which document?    The agreement that we had, \\n\\nit was an agreement that I withdraw as a witness of ICC.    That was the agreement.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:05:55] Yes, tell us about this agreement.    What was this agreement?    In \\n\\nwhat way was this agreement finalised? \\n\\nA.      [15:06:11] I was not even told that there was that contract.    It\\'s only Mr Gicheru \\n\\nwanted me to give him my identity card.    I gave him and then he said, \"You come \\n\\nand wait for me at the reception.\"    And then he left.     \\n\\nAfter one hour or half an hour, he came back to the office.

[15:07:22] Yes, I can remember.    Even his office, I know where it is.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:07:31] Can you tell us whether the name that you recall is among the names \\n\\nof persons in the list that was given to you, the protected list of persons that was \\n\\ngiven to you.   \\n\\nA.      [15:08:01] I\\'m looking for that name, but I can\\'t see it.     \\n\\nYes, I can see it.    Number 32.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:08:29] Thank you, sir.   \\n\\nA.      [15:08:36] Welcome. \\n\\nQ.      [15:08:38] To have clarity about this agreement or contract that you signed, \\n\\nwhere -- where was it, where did you sign this agreement? \\n\\nA.      [15:09:00] These people, they went to prepare that agreement in (Redacted).   \\n\\nMr Gicheru went out and he went to prepare that agreement, saying that I have \\n\\nremoved myself out of that, and then they came back to (Redacted), they   \\n\\nread and asked me to sign.    But this agreement was written in English.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:09:30] Did you sign it? \\n\\nA.      [15:09:33] Yes, I signed.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:09:40] Who asked you specifically to sign this document? \\n\\nA.      [15:10:00] Both of them, number 32 and Mr Gicheru.   \\n\\nQ.

[15:10:23] Yes.    At one time these were -- was after months.    At that time I was \\n\\nstill attending those meetings of the victims.    Then they were concerned, they said \\n\\nyou write another statement.    That was after some months.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:10:53] Tell us about this other statement.    When do you remember -- recall \\n\\napproximately how long after signing the first agreement? \\n\\nA.      [15:11:13] Well, it took a long time.    There is another statement, the third one \\n\\nthey wanted me to write, but I didn\\'t do that.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:11:25] Let\\'s focus on the second statement that you were asked.    Where was \\n\\nit -- mindful that we\\'re still in public session, where did you sign that other \\n\\nstatement? \\n\\nA.      [15:11:47] I think it was in (Redacted).    You know, I can\\'t   \\n\\nremember everything because it has been a long time.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:11:59] Do you remember what that statement said? \\n\\nA.      [15:12:08] If I remember, I wrote with a pen saying that I have withdrawn from \\n\\nICC on that -- and the date which was there.    That\\'s all.    I wrote with my own hand \\n\\nand it was in Kiswahili.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:12:26] And who asked you to sign that document, that second document? \\n\\nA.      [15:12:38] Well, at that time I travelled to go to the place called number 1.    But \\n\\nwhen I came back home, I was pressed a lot by them telling me to write down that \\n\\nstatement.    And the person who was doing that a lot, he is here on number -- yes, \\n\\nnumber 20, this is the person who said that I had to do that.    But you know, this \\n\\nperson now he just involved himself in this issue.    He\\'s here, number 20.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:13:59] Can you tell us what were the pressure that were brought upon you at \\n\\nthat point, what nature, what kind of pressure? \\n\\nA.

[15:14:57] I travelled because I was invited by the investigators of ICC so that we \\n\\ncan meet there.    But despite all that, we didn\\'t meet.    I was called on phone by \\n\\nnumber 13 asking me why, why don\\'t -- why did you go there?    And you know that \\n\\nthere is danger.    Therefore, I had to put an end to that trip and come back home.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:15:36] Do you know how person number 20 knew that you were going to \\n\\nlocation number 1? \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:15:44] Did he say person number 20 or 13?    Can \\n\\nhe clarify?   \\n\\nMS ZAGO:    [15:15:53] He mentioned both.    Your Honour, he mentioned both and \\n\\n(Overlapping speakers)   \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [15:15:58](Interpretation) The number 20 is the one who insisted \\n\\nthat I should write another statement.

And I could not meet with the investigators.   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:16:28] Excuse me, can we have a time, a time period for all of \\n\\nthis?    Because we\\'re not certain when this is all occurring, so if she could possibly \\n\\nask the witness about what time.   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:16:44] You mean about when he made the trip to \\n\\nnumber 1?   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:16:49] Yes, yes, your Honour.

[9:37:22] Okay.    So that\\'s your testimony, right? \\n\\nA.      [9:37:28] That with the assistance of person number 4 I was able to send \\n\\nthe SMS. \\n\\nQ.      [9:37:34] Right.    And we talked about the business cards and the availability of \\n\\nthe numbers elsewhere, but that\\'s your testimony and that\\'s fine.    I want to bring \\n\\nyour attention to something else, and that is when you were being questioned on \\n\\n13 July 2021 you wanted to establish that, that in fact you did have the SMS and that \\n\\nyou did in fact put out a message.    And as I understand it, you wanted to convey \\n\\nthe fact that you never received an answer; is that right?   \\n\\nA.      [9:38:23] Ask your question again. \\n\\nQ.      [9:38:26] Okay.    This matter was brought up for the very first time, you\\'ve \\n\\nindicated, to the investigators, to the OTP when they brought you here in July 2021.   \\n\\nThat was the very first time that you ever mentioned sending an SMS to Mr Gicheru, \\n\\ncorrect? \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [9:38:46] I beg your pardon, your Honour.    May we have \\n\\nthe reference to the part of the interview that my learned friend is referring to so we \\n\\ncan also follow?   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [9:38:56] I will do that.    I will note -- on this occasion I have no \\n\\nproblem, your Honour, but I will note that I would prefer getting the answer first at \\n\\ntimes and I\\'ll -- I\\'ll say why, because the gentleman tends to pivot.    He sees what\\'s on \\n\\nand then he pivots his answers and tailors his answers and that\\'s why I first want to \\n\\ncommit him or recommit him.    I will accredit and then I will confront.

I have seen \\n\\nthis from when we start -- when he started to ask me questions, and not today, also \\n\\nyesterday, the way he\\'s leading his questions can make me commit myself to -- to -- to \\n\\nthe way I didn\\'t mean to.    Therefore, I\\'m asking that any question he\\'s supposed to \\n\\nask, he ask me that I have put in writing in a statement, he refers first to that \\n\\nstatement so that I can give him a precise answer.    It\\'s my humble request, \\n\\nmy Honour. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:40:53] Okay.    Mr Witness, you see, when you \\n\\nstarted testifying here, remember counsel for the Prosecution introduced certain \\n\\nstatements or documents to you that you agreed you had read, in fact immediately \\n\\nbefore coming to this Court, and you even ticked off on them; not so?   \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [9:41:22] Yes, my Honour. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:41:23] So those are some of the statements \\n\\nhe\\'s -- counsel for the Defence is referring to.    It\\'s not that he wants to incriminate \\n\\nyou in any way.    And in any event, he\\'s Defence counsel.    You cannot and \\n\\nwe cannot actually direct him as to, you know, how he wants to do his \\n\\ncross-examination.    I mean, legally speaking he\\'ll do his best.    When he needs to \\n\\nrefer you to documents, of course, he\\'ll draw your attention.    Okay?    But -- and, you \\n\\nknow, if he asks questions that you do not remember -- excuse me, I told you before, \\n\\ntell him that you do not remember.    Tell the Court that you do not remember, you \\n\\nknow.    Then they will guide you.    Just calm down and answer your questions.   \\n\\nOkay. \\n\\n17.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 5 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-052-Red-ENG CT WT 17-02-2022 6/113 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [9:42:10] Thank you, your Honour. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [9:42:11] I\\'m sorry to interrupt you again.    I\\'m sorry I provoked \\n\\nthis debate, your Honour, but my request was actually something different.    My \\n\\nrequest was not that the material necessarily be shown to the witness, but that my \\n\\nlearned friend can alert me and the Prosecution as to what he\\'s referring to so we can \\n\\nfollow and check that he\\'s in fact characterising the previous (Overlapping speakers). \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:42:31] Well, I appreciate it, but I was actually \\n\\naddressing the witness\\'s comments that he just made. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [9:42:36] I understand, your Honour.    But I\\'m addressing my \\n\\nlearned friend\\'s comments a moment ago when he said he didn\\'t want to put this \\n\\nmaterial to the witness.    That wasn\\'t my request.    That\\'s all I\\'m saying.    My request \\n\\nis simply that he let me know what he\\'s referring to, that I can also follow \\n\\nthe evidence. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:42:50] Thank you.    Well, that\\'s between you.   \\n\\nThank you very much. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [9:42:53] Thank you, Madam President. \\n\\nLet\\'s look at tab 78, which starts with 0160-0382. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:43:07] That\\'s binder volume 2. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [9:43:10] Volume 2, yes.

He\\'s come here, he\\'s made \\n\\nallegations.    I\\'m well aware of his need for protection.

[10:00:36] Now, were you supposed to be communicating with those \\n\\nindividuals? \\n\\nA.      [10:00:41] No, and that\\'s why I changed the numbers.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:00:44] You changed the numbers so you can communicate with them? \\n\\nA.      [10:00:51] When I communicated to them, I knew it could cause my security risk \\n\\nbecause I don\\'t know who else they will communicate to after I communicate to them.   \\n\\nAnd that\\'s why I changed the numbers. \\n\\nQ.

[10:01:11] Now, by changing SIMs and changing numbers you were also able to \\n\\ncommunicate with them without your handlers knowing that you were \\n\\ncommunicating with them.

[10:15:13] Because if you had more than one then you would have been lying to \\n\\nthe investigators at the time?   \\n\\nA.      [10:15:25] Yes.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:15:26] Okay.    If we could go to then page 17, and that would be 0135-0526.   \\n\\nJust minor stuff concerning your phone habits. \\n\\nLine 605, you know, you say that:    \"Or to my wife ... [she\\'s the one that] put her SIM \\n\\ncard in this one.\"   \\n\\nSo when you say \"this one\", we\\'re talking about the phone that you had your wife was \\n\\nputting her SIM card in, right? \\n\\nA.      [10:16:09] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [10:16:09] Okay.    So that, if I understand you correctly, when you came to that \\n\\nlocation you brought with you that particular phone? \\n\\nA.      [10:16:19] The phone that I was using, at times my wife would put her SIM card \\n\\nin it. \\n\\nQ.      [10:16:27] Okay.    I understand.

[10:16:48] \"I\\'ve also put the one that I was using in\" -- this other location, in \\n\\nlocation number 4 -- \"to communicate with you?\" \\n\\nSo you also put in a SIM card.    So your wife would have a SIM card, you would have \\n\\na SIM card? \\n\\nA.      [10:17:06] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [10:17:07] Now, did there come a time when you would take out the SIM cards \\n\\nand put other SIM cards in, in that particular phone? \\n\\nA.      [10:17:17] Your question, please. \\n\\nQ.      [10:17:19] Did there come other times, were there times when you would take \\n\\nout your SIM card, the one that you were using in location number 4, to put others \\n\\nSIM cards so you could communicate with your friends or -- or your wife?   \\n\\nA.      [10:17:37] If there are times I could use other SIM cards?   \\n\\nQ.      [10:17:40] Were you using other SIM cards with that particular phone? \\n\\nA.      [10:17:44] I don\\'t remember.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:17:45] You don\\'t remember.    Okay. \\n\\nSo then you go on: \"... yeah, you bought me a phone\" -- because they ask you, \"didn\\'t \\n\\nwe buy you a phone ... to communicate with you?\"   \\n\\nSo, in other words, the investigators are saying this is not a phone that we -- that we \\n\\nrecognise.    You\\'re saying it\\'s yours.    They\\'re asking, did we not buy you one?    And \\n\\nyou say:    \"... yeah, you bought me a phone, but when I was at home, already my ... \\n\\nalso my wife, she had to insert her SIM card into it [and] then I didn\\'t use it from \\n\\n17.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 22 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-052-Red-ENG CT WT 17-02-2022 23/113 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nhere.\"   \\n\\nSo let me ask you this:    The phone that you were provided by the OTP investigators, \\n\\nwere you also supposed to lend that or allow your wife to put her SIM card so she \\n\\ncould also use it? \\n\\nA.      [10:18:39] Remember, by that time I had gone home.    That means I was not \\n\\nhaving any intentions that I will go to this location by the -- by the time my wife used \\n\\nthe phone.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:18:56] So this was a phone provided to you by the OTP investigators.    You \\n\\nhad left the OTP as a witness.    You kept the phone and you said:    \"Here, wifey.   \\n\\nHere you can put your SIM card and use it.\"    Is that how it went, more or less? \\n\\nA.      [10:19:13] I am sorry.    I am not the kind of man who hides phones from their \\n\\nwives.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:19:19] But this was a phone that was given to you by the OTP investigators \\n\\nand now you\\'re giving it to your wife so she could use it while you\\'re using it as well; \\n\\nis that correct? \\n\\nA.      [10:19:31] When I\\'m at risk my wife does too.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:19:37] Now it goes on, they say, the interviewer:   \\n\\n\"OK, just before I go into this ... further, I\\'m just going to have to remind \\n\\nyou -- remind you\" -- I\\'m underscoring that word for you -- \"remind you that it\\'s not \\n\\n[a] good practice to be swapping SIMs, because I can tell you every SIM card that\\'s \\n\\nbeen in this phone, OK?

[10:20:22] I have just answered that I had gone home.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:20:25] I\\'ll take that answer.    I\\'ll take that answer.    You don\\'t have to repeat \\n\\nit.

I ... well, can I ask ... on this phone now, what phone \\n\\nis [this person] calling you ...?\" This is another investigator.    And you say \"This one.\" \\n\\nSo further down, line 629:   \\n\\n\"OK.    So you were never provided a phone when you came into the country?\"   \\n\\nAnd you say: \"No, not yet.\" \\n\\n\"Or a SIM card.\" \\n\\n\"Not yet.\" \\n\\nLine 633: \"OK.    Can I ask you, on this phone ... You said there were some local \\n\\npeople ...\"    And you say \"Yes.\" And then we\\'ve pretty much covered that issue.     \\n\\nSo is it true that at that point neither VWU or the investigators had provided you with \\n\\na phone? \\n\\nA.      [10:21:48] They had not.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:21:49] Okay.    So you were there all by yourself without a phone and that\\'s \\n\\nwhy, thank God, you had that phone from -- from your homeland when you came \\n\\nthere that you were able to buy a SIM and use it    That\\'s a question.    So but for that \\n\\nphone you would not be able to communicate, right? \\n\\nA.      [10:22:23] Yes.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:22:24] If we go on to 0135-0527, that would be page 18, starting with 672:   \\n\\n\"Excuse me.

[10:23:40] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:23:38] So that\\'s what you were doing?    When you were in different \\n\\nlocations you could put your phone in hide identity, and call them wherever you \\n\\nwere, to give the impression that perhaps you were still in -- in Kenya when in fact \\n\\nyou might be somewhere else?   \\n\\nA.      [10:24:00] When I called someone that could pose a security risk to me, and in \\n\\nthat case I called people who were working for me in my -- in my -- in my yard \\n\\non -- on -- on that private -- on that private -- on a private call just to make sure that \\n\\nI am secure when making calls.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:24:24] Okay.    Now if we could go to tab 41.    I\\'m -- I know you\\'ve said this \\n\\nbut I want to be -- be clear on the record.    This is a transcript from the Ruto and Sang \\n\\ncase when you testified.    The date is 21/11/2014.    And it regards on the same topic.   \\n\\nAnd it\\'s page number 9.   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:25:11] Is it in volume 1?    Did you say 41, tab 41?   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:25:17] I said, yeah, tab 41, your Honour.    And it\\'s a transcript.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:25:27] If you could find it, sir.

[10:26:38] If you go to page 9 and you go to line 12:    Question:    \"Sure.

I don\\'t.\" \\n\\nSo can that -- from this, from your testimony under oath, can we conclude that you \\n\\nhad so many phones that you -- you didn\\'t remember how many you had over this \\n\\ntime -- during this period of time?   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [10:27:55] Sorry, your Honour, which period of time is my \\n\\nlearned friend referring to?   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:27:59] Well, the period of time, well the Ruto and Sang case \\n\\nwas talking at this stage his involvement in -- in contacting person number -- number \\n\\n2. \\n\\nQ.      [10:28:22] Is it fair to say that during 2013, 2014, when you were working and \\n\\nbeing handled by the OTP investigators, that you had so many phones and so many \\n\\nSIM cards that you have no -- you\\'re not able to tell us how many?   \\n\\nA.      [10:28:48] Perhaps if you may tell me how I was working for them.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:28:50] You were being handled.   \\n\\nA.      [10:28:56] Thank you.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:28:54] So my question is:    Do you remember how many phones exactly you \\n\\nhad, were using, and how many SIM cards? \\n\\nA.      [10:29:06] I don\\'t remember.     \\n\\nQ.

[10:29:16] I don\\'t remember.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:29:14] Okay.    And then one last on -- this is tab 22.    This is again in \\n\\nthe same case, different date, 26/11/2014.     \\n\\nAnd now it\\'s Mr Steynberg who is asking the questions, so perhaps he doesn\\'t need \\n\\nhis memory refreshed on the time that we\\'re talking about.    And he poses \\n\\nthe question to you on line 10, this is on page 106:   \\n\\n\"You were confronted at a certain stage with an analysis report -- a cell phone analysis \\n\\nreport by my learned friend for the Ruto team.\"   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:30:06] Which page, please?   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:30:08] 106, your Honour.

Twenty-two. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:30:29] And page? \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:30:32] Page 106, starting around line 10.    Mr Steynberg is \\n\\nasking a question. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:30:42] Yes, please. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:     \\n\\nQ.      [10:30:45] And he\\'s asking you about being confronted with a -- a cell phone \\n\\nanalysis report.    Do you recall that?   \\n\\nA.      [10:30:53] Yes.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:30:51] And do you recall being confronted, actually, with that report, not just \\n\\nthe question of it, but actually seeing a report that they showed you? \\n\\nA.      [10:31:04] Yes.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:31:01] And that, basically, that was the report -- it was an extraction report.   \\n\\n17.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 27 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-052-Red-ENG CT WT 17-02-2022 28/113 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nThey wanted to find out what exactly was happening in that particular phone, to \\n\\nextract all the information? \\n\\nA.      [10:31:16] Yes.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:31:15] Okay.    Because they wanted to know whoever was using that \\n\\nphone - and I presume it was you, because it was your phone - they wanted to know \\n\\nwhat activities you were up to, who you were communicating with and who was \\n\\ncommunicating with you, right?   \\n\\nA.      [10:31:36] They wanted to see the communication that I had done to the person \\n\\nnumber --     \\n\\nQ.      [10:31:42] All right.   \\n\\nA.      [10:31:45] The person -- the person number -- it is number 2 you mentioned.   \\n\\nNumber ... yes, person number 2.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:31:51] But also in general what was going on with that particular phone, \\n\\nwho else you were communicating with.    Or was it just strictly targeting person \\n\\nnumber 2 and nobody else? \\n\\nA.      [10:32:06] To my understanding on that -- the need for that extraction that -- that \\n\\nwe have spoken about was to see the communication with person number 2.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:32:14] All right.    And then Mr Steynberg goes on at line 15:   \\n\\n\"Before I get to [this] report -- to the report, you were also asked at a certain stage how \\n\\nmany SIM cards you had while you were in the protected location.    You couldn\\'t \\n\\nrecall how many, but can I ask you this:    Was it one SIM card or more than one \\n\\nSIM card.\" \\n\\nAnd you answer: \"More than one.     \\n\\nAnd did you just use one SIM card in one phone?

You could pick either one of these.   \\n\\nAnd your answer is: \"Every SIM card had a phone.    I was advised not to mix SIM \\n\\ncards which I was calling different people like OTP, my family.    I was given different \\n\\nphones for specific purposes.\"    Right?     \\n\\nBut isn\\'t that a fact, sir, that you were mixing SIM cards at the time?    Perhaps out of \\n\\nnecessity, but you were in fact mixing SIM cards, taking them in and taking them out, \\n\\nand that\\'s why you had been previously warned that that was a dangerous practice \\n\\nfor your own security purposes?   \\n\\nA.      [10:34:02] Like I told you even before you came to this, that there were different \\n\\nphones with different purposes and there were phones that I could -- I could use \\n\\nfreely even by changing the SIM card.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:34:16] Okay.    Now we\\'re going to stick on the issue of phones.     \\n\\nI apologise for everybody, it\\'s not a terribly sexy topic, but it\\'s an important one.    So \\n\\nI\\'m going to be sort of going into a subsection of the phone topic about you and your \\n\\nanswering habits, or turning off habits of the phone.    And if you may recall, \\n\\nyesterday I posed a question or two about you turning off your phone and being \\n\\nin -- unavailable to the investigators while you were working with them.    Do you \\n\\nrecall that? \\n\\nA.      [10:35:03] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:35:02] And it\\'s a fact that you were at times turning off your phone, right? \\n\\nA.      [10:35:16] I could do so.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:35:16] I know you can.   \\n\\nA.      [10:35:20] Like that time you have just spoken about.   \\n\\nQ.

[10:35:24] The time you have just spoken about, it were off.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:35:25] Okay.    And I also mentioned a couple of other things about VWU \\n\\nfinding -- you know, confronting you at times about that, about your phones.    And \\n\\nin fact in one instance, I may not have raised it but we\\'re going to get to it, at one \\n\\ninstance they didn\\'t trust you, they thought that you could not possibly have six \\n\\nphones.    Do you recall that? \\n\\nA.      [10:35:59] I don\\'t.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:35:56] Okay.    We\\'re going to get to that slowly. \\n\\nSo let\\'s look at, first, tab 36 and it\\'s 0107-0289.    This is an investigative report.    It was \\n\\nfiled on 14 May 2013.    If you could find it, and when you find it please let us know.   \\n\\nA.      [10:36:28] I have it.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:36:29] Okay.    And it does refer -- it is in reference to you, is it not? \\n\\nA.      [10:36:42] It is.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:36:43] Okay.    And so we begin on Monday:    \"On 14 May 2013 in this \\n\\nmorning\" -- I don\\'t know, can I say this in public, the number, P-3 ... \\n\\nMr Steynberg, are you going to get excited, or anybody else? \\n\\nA.      [10:37:08] I do, because that number could identify me.    That\\'s why it was \\n\\nchanged to the current number. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:37:15] Okay.    All right. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:37:16] Thank you very much, Mr Witness, yes. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [10:37:17] That this morning they received two SMS to the duty phone, 8:26, 8:43, \\n\\n\"informing that his usual line\" - meaning your line - \"was off and he is [un]reachable \\n\\nnow reachable on\" -- that \"he is reachable now reachable on a new number\".     \\n\\nDo you recall that?

[10:38:05] I don\\'t remember.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:38:06] Okay.    I know you don\\'t remember, but you would not be disputing \\n\\nwhat is in this report, would you?   \\n\\nA.      [10:38:16] I am not disputing.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:38:17] Okay.    All right.    So then it says that you were called by a couple of \\n\\ninvestigators and a meeting was arranged on that particular day at 13:10.    Do you \\n\\nrecall being called for a meeting?   \\n\\nA.      [10:38:36] I don\\'t remember.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:38:34] Okay.    And then it says that you apologised for having your phone \\n\\nswitched off since the previous Friday, 10 May 2013, and that for not being in contact \\n\\nwith the team.    \"He said that he had been away from -- from his apartment since \\n\\n7 p.m. on Saturday, 11 May 2013.

So we\\'re in a different period now.    \"But he \\n\\nwas unreachable.\"    That you said that you were \"unreachable probably because of \\n\\na poor network coverage.\"    And in addition, you had gone to church and then \\n\\nafterwards you had -- you went to take a sauna and that\\'s why you turned off \\n\\nthe phones. \\n\\nDo you recall that?   \\n\\nA.      [10:52:02] I don\\'t recall.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:52:03] Okay.    But during this period do you have any recollection as to \\n\\nwhether you were still having contacts with the investigators and whether you were \\n\\nassisting them in whatever capacity?

We have \\n\\ntwo investigators met you.    The objective of the meeting was for you to make \\n\\na phone call to -- can I say the number -- say this number?

Do you recall sending such a message? \\n\\nA.      [10:54:36] Yes.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:54:37] Okay.    And maybe we can cut this a little bit short.    There was an \\n\\nincident.    You went out at night, around 10 o\\'clock or so.    You were coming back \\n\\nfrom a -- a small shop.    Right?   \\n\\nA.      [10:54:54] Yes.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:54:55] And the long and short of it was you were mugged? \\n\\nA.      [10:55:00] Yes.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:54:59] You weren\\'t harmed?    You were not harmed? \\n\\nA.      [10:55:06] Yes.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:55:05] They just told you \"stand there\".    They told you to stand, and you \\n\\ndid, right?    That\\'s a question.   \\n\\nA.      [10:55:19] No.     \\n\\nQ.      [10:55:21] Okay.    All right.    It says here \"they said (Redacted)\" and in that \\n\\nlanguage means \"stand there\".

[10:59:01] They\\'re saying here that they received an SMS from you, and they \\n\\npassed it on.    And when the investigators met you, you confirmed what they learned \\n\\nfrom the SMS. \\n\\n17.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 40 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-052-Red-ENG CT WT 17-02-2022 41/113 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nSo whether you sent an SMS or not, that\\'s not at issue.    What we\\'re dealing with is \\n\\nwhether you represented that three phones were taken from you, and you said yes. \\n\\nNow, \"Later in the evening, (Redacted) reported to the investigators that   \\n\\nin the morning, VWU staff paid a surprise visit to [you] in [your] house after he \\n\\nreported the loss of his phones and money.    The VWU staff said that they found \\n\\n[a laptop] and three phones in [your] house.    The VWU staff asked [you] about \\n\\n[the three] phones and he said that those phones were left [at] home, and [that] he did \\n\\nnot have them when he was attacked.    It seems that the VWU staff doesn\\'t trust \\n\\n[you], they don\\'t believe that he had 6 phones.\" \\n\\nNow we\\'re going to stop here because I see the clock.    But when I -- we come back \\n\\nI\\'m going to ask you about what you represented earlier, that you only had one phone, \\n\\nand know we -- we have six.    Now I understand the periods are different, but maybe \\n\\nyou have an explanation. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [11:00:48] Well this is a convenient time to stop.   \\n\\nWe\\'ll return to court for 11.30. \\n\\nThank you. \\n\\nTHE COURT USHER:    [11:00:57] All rise. \\n\\n(Recess taken at 11.00 a.m.)   \\n\\n(Upon resuming in open session at 11.32 a.m.) \\n\\nTHE COURT USHER:    [11:32:43] All rise. \\n\\nPlease be seated. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [11:32:56] Good morning, again. \\n\\nMr Karnavas, the interpreters would want for you to really slow down the pace at \\n\\nwhich you ask questions and allow the witness to answer before putting another \\n\\nquestions. \\n\\n17.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 41 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-052-Red-ENG CT WT 17-02-2022 42/113 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nAnd I want to say that, you know, the pace of the testimony is really too slow, and \\n\\nmaybe if we can work on that a little bit, Mr Karnavas. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [11:33:30] I\\'m trying --   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [11:33:31] So that, you know, you put questions that \\n\\nare really, really necessary, I should say. \\n\\nI\\'d also want to remind the witness again that, as I said when we started off, you are \\n\\nprotected, but don\\'t get into arguments with counsel.    Answer the questions that are \\n\\nput to you, and maybe avoid telling a lot of stories, especially things that you would \\n\\nhave said before.    And if you could answer the questions accurately and, you know, \\n\\nI think that that would help us with -- with time. \\n\\nMy intention, actually, is to finish the testimony of this witness today, if we may.    So \\n\\nwhat I intend to do is actually to shorten our lunch break.    So when we go away for \\n\\nlunch for 1 o\\'clock, if we could come back at 2 o\\'clock, so that we can take it between 2 \\n\\nand 4, and use the 30 minutes between 2 and 2.30.    So we start off at 2 and maybe \\n\\nleave at 4 o\\'clock.     \\n\\nSo let\\'s try and make much of the time that we have, Mr Karnavas, and I\\'ll appreciate \\n\\nthat.    Thank you very much. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [11:34:52] Your Honour, if I may, as regards the schedule, if I \\n\\nmight indicate that, at this stage, the Prosecution would probably request about \\n\\n15 minutes for re-examination. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [11:35:02] Well, let\\'s see.

Now, turning to tab 37, April 27, 2015, we\\'re still going to \\n\\nstick with the issue of phones and your communications. \\n\\nSo if you could look at tab 37.    The date is 27 April 2015.

[11:36:40] I don\\'t recall.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:36:41] Okay.    And it says that on the 31st, that you had advised that you \\n\\ncould meet with him at a later time.    That\\'s on the second paragraph.    Do you see it? \\n\\nA.      [11:36:53] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:36:54] And then on the 1st, he received a text message from you.    \"Where, \\n\\nsir?\"    Where to meet, basically.    And you were advised later in the day -- or you \\n\\nadvised later in the day. \\n\\nAnd then on August 2, the next day, he receives a message that basically said, I guess, \\n\\nthat you were ill; is that right? \\n\\nA.      [11:37:32] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [11:37:32] And then on the 4th, still trying to reach you, it says that he received, \\n\\nthe investigator received the following message from you:    \"Let it be Tuesday am not \\n\\nfeeling well.\" \\n\\n17.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 43 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-052-Red-ENG CT WT 17-02-2022 44/113 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Private Session)                                              ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nAnd then it goes on.

[11:58:16] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [11:58:16] Okay.    And do you stand by that?    Do you stand by that statement \\n\\nthat you made, that answer? \\n\\nA.      [11:58:27] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [11:58:28] Okay.    That\\'s it.    That\\'s all I wanted.    I wanted a confirmation that \\n\\nyou were not supposed to -- you had to seek permission.    That\\'s all.     \\n\\nNow, if we could go to tab 1.    Tab 1.    Another housekeeping matter.    It\\'s 0135-0103.   \\n\\nAnd it\\'s on page 3 that I\\'m going to be, you know, referring to.    Just a quick matter.     \\n\\nAnd while you\\'re looking for it, yesterday I asked you whether you had any contact \\n\\nwith witness number 18 on the list while you were in situ in location number 6.    And \\n\\nI specifically, if you might recall, asked you if you had visited her while she had taken \\n\\nill.    And you could not remember.   \\n\\nA.      [11:59:36] Yes, I could not remember. \\n\\nQ.      [11:59:38] Now, if we look at line 98, starting with line 98, or somewhere there, \\n\\nyou seemed very loyal then.    \"Now, my mission there, because\" -- I\\'m going to skip \\n\\nthe name -- \"now knew [that number 18], and [number 18] had refused to receive \\n\\nphone calls from me, from them, when I left [location number -- goodness -- location \\n\\nnumber 18] ... when I left [location number 6].

[12:01:31] Yes, I did confirm that we used to communicate with -- with -- with \\n\\nher, too, when we were in the -- in the programme. \\n\\nQ.      [12:01:40] Right.    There\\'s a difference between communicating and meeting.   \\n\\nAnd my question was, yesterday --   \\n\\nA.      [12:01:45] Yes, this incident, I remember now it happened. \\n\\nQ.      [12:01:48] Okay.    So you did visit her.    You had a one-on-one, a tête-à-tête with \\n\\nher while she was recuperating, and you told her what -- what I just read, right? \\n\\nA.      [12:01:58] Exactly. \\n\\nQ.      [12:02:00] Okay.    Thank you.     \\n\\nNow we\\'ll move on to another topic.    Again, I\\'ll try to keep this punchy and short.   \\n\\nAnd this is in regards to person number 2.    I\\'m going to refer to tab 32.    Tab 32.   \\n\\nAnd it\\'s 0111-0140.    And by way of predicate, it refers to one of your answers from \\n\\nyesterday, which is on page 120 and 121 of the transcript that we received last night, \\n\\nand it had to do with communications with -- you know, your conversations with \\n\\nperson number 2. \\n\\nSo if we could look at tab 32, and we could -- if we could look at page 7, page 7, which \\n\\nis 0111-0146.    Do you have it? \\n\\nA.      [12:03:35] Yes.    Page 7?   \\n\\nQ.      [12:03:37] Yes.   \\n\\nA.      [12:03:38] Which paragraph?   \\n\\nQ.      [12:03:40] Well, it\\'s 32.    The very, very last.    Incidentally, you see that these are \\n\\nsummaries of your conversations, right?    This is not an answer -- question, answer, \\n\\n17.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 55 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-052-Red-ENG CT WT 17-02-2022 56/113 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nquestion, answer.    This a summary, the gist of -- of what you talked, and you \\n\\ninitialled and you signed, right?   \\n\\nA.      [12:04:01] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [12:04:03] All right.    So if we look at paragraph 33: \"Between this time and my \\n\\nmeeting with [person number 2] I received about 4 phone calls from him which I \\n\\nreceived all in public so I did not record these calls.    These 4 calls were received after \\n\\n[person number 2] arrived at 9pm on\" -- this particular date, I think I\\'m not supposed \\n\\nto mention -- \"and all these calls related to logistics of us meeting on the [next day].   \\n\\nApart from the logistics of our meeting I did not discuss [any] details of [my] -- of any \\n\\noffer.    My phone did not capture the data of these calls.\" \\n\\n\"My phone\" -- I\\'m going to repeat that.    \"My phone did not capture that data of these \\n\\ncalls and I see that the received calls log is empty.    I do not know how this may have \\n\\noccurred.\" \\n\\nThose were your words, right?   \\n\\nA.      [12:05:14] Yes, on this date. \\n\\nQ.      [12:05:15] Okay.    And so, other than your representations, other than your \\n\\nrepresentations, we don\\'t know exactly what really -- you know, what you all talked \\n\\nabout, what you and person number 2 talked about, during those four phone calls, \\n\\nright?    Because we don\\'t have a record, so we don\\'t -- other than what you\\'re telling \\n\\nus, we don\\'t -- we can\\'t verify it objectively, can we? \\n\\nA.      [12:05:45] There are no records. \\n\\nQ.      [12:05:46] Okay.    Now, if we -- one more matter on this -- on this topic. \\n\\nTab 41.    Tab 41, this is from a transcript dated 21/11/2014, and I\\'m going to be \\n\\nreferring to page 22.    So tab 41, if you could find it.   \\n\\nA.

So if you could sort \\n\\nof look at lines 8 to 19 very quickly, or 18, and then I\\'ll -- I\\'ll read from line 19:   \\n\\n\"Where is the recording of the conversation where [person number 2] is telling you \\n\\n[all of] this?\"    This is in regards to what you\\'re saying above, that there\\'s information \\n\\nabout new witnesses and what have you.     \\n\\nAnd your answer is:    \"There is no recording because I said at some stage I was not \\n\\nsure of ... what time I was discussing this with -- with [person number 2], but I gave \\n\\nthat -- I had information that at our discussions sometimes we -- we had -- we had \\n\\ndiscussed and he told me about what I informed -- everything that I got from [person \\n\\nnumber 2] I informed -- [and] I felt was -- was of need for -- for -- for -- for record I \\n\\ninformed the investigators.\" \\n\\nDo you recall saying that, sir? \\n\\nA.      [12:10:24] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [12:10:26] Okay.

[12:11:23] When you have it, sir, page number 2, let me know.    And you can go \\n\\nright down to line 62.   \\n\\nA.      [12:11:36] Sorry, what?     \\n\\nQ.      [12:11:39] Okay.    The tab is 66; six, six.   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [12:11:44] It\\'s in your second binder. \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [12:11:46] Yes, I can see it in my second --   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [12:11:50] \\n\\nQ.      [12:11:50] Okay.    Great, great.

You couldn\\'t remember which number he was calling you from? \\n\\nA.      [12:13:16] But is it person number 2 that --   \\n\\nQ.      [12:13:19] I mean person number 4.    I\\'m sorry.    I apologise.    Person number 4.   \\n\\nA.      [12:13:23] I could not recall what number exactly he called me through. \\n\\nQ.      [12:13:27] Okay.    And, again, this is March 26, 2014.     \\n\\nNow we go to another document.    It\\'s -- which is in tab 67.    Tab 67.    And now this \\n\\nis 2 July 2014.    Tab 67, 0135-0509.    If we go to page 25.     \\n\\nAgain, it relates to person number 4.    And you\\'ve told us that he was a very close \\n\\nand dear friend of yours, and you communicated quite often with.    If we can go to \\n\\nnow line 915: \\n\\n\"All right.    When [person number 4] called you, what number did he call you from?\" \\n\\nAnswer:    \"I don\\'t recall that number now.    You know, [number 4] has so many \\n\\nnumbers.\" \\n\\n\"And where is that [SMS] -- that SIM card, the SIM card for 0-7-0-5?    Where is that \\n\\nSIM card now?\" \\n\\nYour answer:    \"I left it at home ...\" \\n\\n\"Okay.\" \\n\\nThen you go on:    \"... because I felt that most people knew that number.

It will just be seen in a lot of ... plus, the phone \\n\\nthat ... most often, that number, I used in ... left it at home.\"     \\n\\nSo, again, what you\\'re telling the investigators is, at this stage, you don\\'t recall which \\n\\n17.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 60 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-052-Red-ENG CT WT 17-02-2022 61/113 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nnumber you were communicating with person number 4; is that right? \\n\\nA.      [12:15:43] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [12:15:44] Okay.    All right.     \\n\\nLet\\'s move on to something more exciting, I guess.    Another small, very small \\n\\nhousekeeping matter.    And this in regards to what you testified on direct and what \\n\\nyou testified yesterday.    No trick questions.    So I\\'m just going to put to you what \\n\\nyou said on -- on direct and then what you said on cross yesterday and give you an \\n\\nopportunity to maybe clarify the discrepancy.    Okay?     \\n\\nSo this is in regards to you returning back home, you know, leaving the field and \\n\\ncoming back the first time, and when you meet person number 4.    Okay, we talked \\n\\nabout the big lie, but now we\\'re onto the second version, which is you meeting \\n\\nnumber 4, who then will take you to meet with Mr Gicheru.    Okay?   \\n\\nA.      [12:16:50] Yes.     \\n\\nQ.      [12:16:51] All right.    So on -- on direct examination -- and I\\'m looking at \\n\\npage 78.    And this is on -- this is 2/15/2022.    After these meetings with person \\n\\nnumber 2, did there come a time, stage where you left location number 6 and \\n\\nreturned to Kenya?     \\n\\nAnd then you go on --   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [12:17:21] Which tab are you looking at, Mr Karnavas, \\n\\nplease?   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [12:17:25] I was looking -- I wasn\\'t aware that I needed to have \\n\\na tab from the -- this is from the transcript, your Honour.

[12:17:56] So it says here:    \"After [the] -- after these meetings with person \\n\\nnumber 2, did there come a stage where you left location number 6 and returned to \\n\\nKenya?\" \\n\\nDo you recall being asked that question? \\n\\nA.      [12:18:13] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [12:18:13] Okay.    And then further down, around line number 14 -- I\\'m trying \\n\\nto save time:    \"I made this decision myself when I left location ... number 6.    I made \\n\\na decision ... to go back home.\" \\n\\nQuestion:    \"All right.    And after you return home, did there come a time when you \\n\\nwere again in contact with person -- with persons [contacted] to -- connected to \\n\\nthe witness bribery scheme?\" \\n\\nAnswer:    \"Yes, my Honour.    I knew back of my mind that it was in public domain \\n\\nthat I was -- [that] I was involved in issues to do with this Court.    And my safety was \\n\\nin jeopardy ...\" \\n\\nAnd then you go on:    \"Therefore, I tried my level best, now that I [have] information \\n\\nof who was concerned in making sure that ... people -- when witnesses go back home \\n\\nthey live safely ...\" \\n\\nDo you recall saying that? \\n\\nA.      [12:19:20] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:19:21] Okay.    And then you go on, and to make it short, page 80, line 24.     \\n\\nTHE INTERPRETER:    [12:19:32] Counsel, please wait for it to be brought up on \\n\\nthe screen, and slow down. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [12:19:37] Mr Karnavas, the interpreters want you to \\n\\nslow down so that, you know, the transcript that you are reading from can be brought \\n\\nup on the screen, please. \\n\\n17.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 62 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-052-Red-ENG CT WT 17-02-2022 63/113 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [12:19:49] Right.

[12:20:08] So if we go to page 80, line 24, and it says:    \"And what transpired \\n\\nnext ... regards your wish to get in touch with Mr Gicheru?\" \\n\\n\"Person number 4 is the one who introduced me to Mr Gicheru.\" \\n\\nThis is on the next page now.   \\n\\n\"And please tell the Chamber how that came about.\"     \\n\\n\"Person number 4 is a good friend of mine.

[12:20:50] I gave the number 2.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:20:53] Okay.    And then if we could just move to the next page, page 82, \\n\\nline 5. \\n\\nQuestion:    \"All right.    I\\'d like to move on then ... -- well, you said that person \\n\\nnumber 4 helped [you] -- put you in touch with Mr Gicheru, the accused.

Well, that\\'s not what is -- that\\'s not what is over here, but I\\'ll \\n\\nleave it to the Court to make sense of then.    If you\\'re changing -- because right here it \\n\\nappears to say that you met person number 4 in (Redacted).   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [12:22:11] Your Honour, my reading is also not -- it doesn\\'t say \\n\\nthat.     \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [12:22:15] Well, I\\'ll leave it --     \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [12:22:16] It says person number 4 --   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [12:22:17] I\\'ll move on.

Because you\\'ve told us earlier that when we -- when I first -- the first \\n\\ndocument, that you signed it, you glanced at it, it wasn\\'t what you had written -- what \\n\\nyou had said.    Now they\\'re asking you did you sign any other documents, whether \\n\\nthey were blank, blank sheets of paper or otherwise.

I don\\'t recall whether they were with pages, [whether] they \\n\\nwere blank[s].     \\n\\nThey were blank[s]?     \\n\\nYes.     \\n\\nOK, so you had to sign, not just the last page, which [was] something on it.\"    Which \\n\\nis what you said initially.    \"That\\'s what you\\'re saying?     \\n\\n17.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 81 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-052-Red-ENG CT WT 17-02-2022 82/113 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nYes.     \\n\\nSo you\\'re saying the last page actually had writing on it, but you had to sign each \\n\\nof ...\" \\n\\nAnd you say:    \"Yes.

[14:05:05] I remember the signing that had the written words was that last bit. \\n\\nQ.      [14:05:12] Okay.    And then just to finish up on this, on the next page they just \\n\\nsay I\\'m going to -- \"What I\\'m going to do\" -- this is on line 406:    \"What I\\'m going to \\n\\ndo is I\\'m going to print this out tomorrow, and I\\'m going to get you to go through \\n\\n[it] ...\"     \\n\\nNow I wasn\\'t there so I don\\'t know what exactly was happening, but had they shown \\n\\nyou a document and they were saying:    Okay, this document, I\\'m going to print it \\n\\nout tomorrow and then we\\'re going to go through it, or were you just talking about \\n\\nyour affidavit from the top of your head?   \\n\\nA.

And if go to page 1, 0135-0214, it says that -- this is, at the very \\n\\nend, number 30 -- line 39:    I got here\" is my name a six-page -- \"in my hands a \\n\\n6-page affidavit.\"    Okay?     \\n\\nAnd if we go to the next page, very first line 41, we have the KEN number, that\\'s \\n\\nprobably all I\\'m going to get out of this one for now, which is 0116-0261 to 66.    And \\n\\nso -- and that\\'s tab number 25.    So this is what they were showing you. \\n\\nDo you recall seeing this?   \\n\\nA.      [14:07:49] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:07:49] Okay.    I\\'ll move along to the next one.     \\n\\nTab number 5.    Tab number 5.    And this is 0135-0220.    And for the record, what we \\n\\nsaw previously was on 27 March and, again, we are still on 27 March.     \\n\\nNow, in this document -- you may need to have also handy tab 24, tab 24, 0130-0087.     \\n\\nSo looking at tab number 5, if we could go to page 2.    I\\'m going rather fast on this \\n\\nbut trying to save time. \\n\\nIf we go to page 2 and we go to line 68.    Here is the -- here is the investigator:   \\n\\n\"Could it have been -- could it have been that you signed a document with that \\n\\ninformation on it?    Do you recall that? \\n\\nOK.

[14:09:56] With the situation I was (Overlapping speakers)   \\n\\nQ.      [14:10:02] Yeah, I\\'m just asking (Overlapping speakers)   \\n\\nA.      [14:10:02] Actually, that\\'s why I say I might have signed (Overlapping speakers)   \\n\\nQ.      [14:10:07] Okay.    All right.     \\n\\nNow this is the important part.    If we go to the next page, if we go to the next page, \\n\\nline 80.    \"What I\\'m going to ask you to do [...] is to put your signature on the first \\n\\npage of that document.    You\\'re not signing anything this time.    I\\'m not going to \\n\\nlodge this with any court.\" \\n\\nOkay.    Now if we go down to line 89, the interviewer says:   \\n\\nThe 27th -- and we\\'ll see it in a moment.    \"Yes.\"    You can -- \"And can I get you to \\n\\nplace your initial on\" each -- you know, \"on every page?\"    I apologise for my reading, \\n\\nI\\'m a little sleep deprived. \\n\\nBut here they\\'re asking you to sign the first page and initial all the other pages.    Do \\n\\nyou see that? \\n\\nA.      [14:11:11] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [14:11:12] And they\\'re telling you it\\'s the 27th, because as we noted, it\\'s \\n\\n27 March 2014.    Do you see that?   \\n\\nA.      [14:11:19] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [14:11:19] Okay.

[14:25:18] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:25:18] And I just want to draw everyone\\'s attention to 358, line 358.   \\n\\nBecause it gives a reference, a KEN number, and that will assist us to see what exactly \\n\\nis being shown to the gentleman at the time. \\n\\nAnd it\\'s, it\\'s titled \"The unsigned version of affidavit in\" person number -- number 2.   \\n\\nOkay.

It\\'s shown to you and you say:    \"Yes, this is ... what I \\n\\nsigned in Nairobi.\"     \\n\\nSo do you recall being shown during -- this was last summer now, you were shown \\n\\nthis unsigned affidavit -- or it was titled \"unsigned affidavit\" and you said, \"Yes, this \\n\\nis what I signed in Nairobi.\"    Do you recall saying that? \\n\\nA.      [14:26:48] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [14:26:48] Okay.    And you said -- further on you say:    \"This is the document I \\n\\nwent to sign [...] in Nairobi.    When I ... when I was ...

[14:28:57] I recall. \\n\\nQ.      [14:28:59] Okay.    And that\\'s what you testified under oath a couple of days ago \\n\\nas well, right? \\n\\nA.      [14:29:08] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [14:29:08] All right.    And that\\'s when you went and you waited for about \\n\\n15 minutes, as I understand your testimony, before somebody came, right?   \\n\\nA.      [14:29:20] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [14:29:20] And that person happened to be person number 13.    The one -- one \\n\\nof the names on the firm.   \\n\\nA.      [14:29:41] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:29:45] Okay.    And then on -- on line 425 on page 12 of the same document:     \\n\\n\"Did you meet Mr Gicheru concerning this?   \\n\\nWhen I met Mr Gicheru, he spoke of ... of ... a different affidavit generally, he did not \\n\\ntell me specifically which one and then which one.\"     \\n\\nSo that\\'s what we have here. \\n\\nNow we go to tab number 8.    Tab number 8.    And that\\'s 0160-0400.    And just \\n\\na couple of minor points.    It\\'s page 21, 21, 0160-0421, line 747:    \"OK, but was \\n\\nMr Gicheru\" -- I\\'ll wait for you to find it.   \\n\\nA.      [14:30:46] Yes, I have it. \\n\\nQ.      [14:30:47] Okay.

And then you say:    \"I met him in Nairobi too, the same \\n\\nday.\"    Meaning you met Gicheru in Nairobi the same day. \\n\\nDo you see that?    That\\'s on line 754.   \\n\\nA.      [14:31:43] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [14:31:44] Then you\\'re asked:     \\n\\n\"For the affidavit for [number 2]?     \\n\\nNo, in Nairobi.\" \\n\\nFurther down, 759 line 759:   \\n\\n\"That is ... that is [an] affidavit for [number 2, person number 2].

When I went to Nairobi, after signing \\n\\nthe affidavit\" - after signing the affidavit - \"I met him.\" \\n\\nNow let\\'s go to the final tab, tab number 10, so I tried to condense this one hour or so \\n\\nto I think a manageable time.    And hopefully some clarity. \\n\\nIf we go to tab number 10 and if we -- this is 0160-0489 on page 5, which would be \\n\\n0160-0494. \\n\\nSo --   \\n\\nA.

[14:35:02] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:35:03] And further down you say in 198, that it was -- you gave the name \\n\\nthat it was number 13.    You\\'re being asked was it number 13.    You say, \"By the way, \\n\\nI don\\'t even know -- I don\\'t know them in person.\" \\n\\nFurther down, 201: \"I don\\'t know [number 11], I don\\'t know [13].

That \\n\\n[this is where] I was taken to the underground ...\"    So you were supposed to wait for \\n\\nthe boss in the underground.    The ladies took you there, the secretaries, right?   \\n\\nA.      [14:36:26] It\\'s my personal description that they are the secretaries because they \\n\\nwere there.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:36:30] Okay.    Well that was your choice of words, not mine.    All right. \\n\\nNow -- and you were told for the boss -- if we look at line 225, you had to wait for \\n\\nthe boss to come.     \\n\\nAnd then later on on line 234:   \\n\\n\"This gentleman arrived and he brought the affidavit prepared.\"    He brought \\n\\nthe affidavit prepared.    \"he asked me to sign the affidavit.    It\\'s everything that I\\'ve \\n\\ndiscussing with Mr Gicheru and ... and everything that Mr Gicheru had told him ... \\n\\nand he ... He prepared everything ready as a lawyer ...

[14:41:13] Okay.    Thank you.    Now if we move on a little bit.     \\n\\nAnd I\\'m going to try to keep this very short.    I\\'m almost there, your Honour, with \\n\\nthis and then one more topic and ...   \\n\\nThen you say that -- you\\'re being asked about Mr Gicheru, page number 8.    Well, I \\n\\nwant to -- \"... when I left -- when I left is when we went back to see Mr Gicheru and \\n\\nwe had lunch together.\"    That\\'s line -- line 264, 265. \\n\\nSo when you left, (Redacted) upstairs, you\\'re underground. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [14:42:04] You\\'re in open session. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [14:42:05]   \\n\\n17.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 97 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-052-Red-ENG CT WT 17-02-2022 98/113 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nQ.      [14:42:05] You sign.    You sign.    You both leave and then you go to lunch, and \\n\\nthat\\'s when you meet Mr Gicheru.    That\\'s what you said, right?   \\n\\nA.      [14:42:17] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [14:42:18] Okay.    So in other words, in this version at least Mr Gicheru is \\n\\nnot -- you haven\\'t told us anywhere, I haven\\'t found it here, in 2021, that Mr Gicheru \\n\\nwas at the office waiting.    Rather, you met him after the signing ceremony, right?   \\n\\nA.      [14:42:41] I have not discussed about it here. \\n\\nQ.      [14:42:42] All right.    Well, I\\'m saying -- I\\'m just -- I\\'m just discussing what you \\n\\ndiscussed.    Okay. \\n\\nAnd later, if we go to the next page, page 9, line 300:     \\n\\n\"OK. So, as well as the ... typed affidavit, did you sign anything else?     \\n\\nI don\\'t know.    I can\\'t remember very well but I remember -- I remember going to \\n\\na cybercafe to ... with [person number 4] and it\\'s like ... I wrote an email.    There\\'s an \\n\\nemail I must have wrote ... somewhere in Nairobi on [that] day.\"   \\n\\nSo.    And then further down you say:    \"At the instructions of Mr Gicheru.\"    And \\n\\nthen further down, line 318: \\n\\n\"I remember it\\'s like after we left from ... from the lunch with him, on our way, it\\'s like \\n\\nwe stopped to go to a cybercafe ... to write that ...\"    This is line 318 to 319.   \\n\\nAnd then you\\'re asked: \"Did he go with you to a cybercafe on [that occasion] or just \\n\\non this -- on other occasions or just on this -- this one occasion that you can recall?     \\n\\nNo, only one.    Only one.\" \\n\\nAnd then page 10, line 330:    \"... in fact he remained in the car and we left with \\n\\n[person number 4] to go ... because it was somewhere upstairs.\"    So the cybercafe \\n\\nmust have been somewhere upstairs. \\n\\nAnd then you\\'re asked if you signed any blank pages, \"Do you recall saying that?\"   \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n17.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 98 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-052-Red-ENG CT WT 17-02-2022 99/113 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nSo now they\\'re reminding you, \"By the way, hey, you\\'ve told us before that you \\n\\nsigned some blank pages, what\\'s going on?\"    And so you say: \"Yeah, they just \\n\\nput\" -- you say you put, \"You just put your signature to ... a blank page, empty page.     \\n\\nYes.     \\n\\nSeveral pages.    Is that correct?\"     \\n\\nSo they\\'re kind of helping your memory along, jogging it, making sure that you -- you \\n\\nget it right.    And you say, \"Yes.    That\\'s correct.\"    Do you see that, sir?   \\n\\nA.      [14:45:17] Yes, I see it.   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [14:45:20] We\\'ll stop right here, your Honour, on this topic.    And \\n\\nI hope I\\'ve made my points clear and I appreciate the Court\\'s indulgence. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    That\\'s fine.   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [14:45:31] Now I want to go to another topic.    Hopefully it won\\'t \\n\\nbe as painfully long.    I\\'ll try to keep it snappy.    This too is a sort of like a difficult \\n\\none.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:45:52] You were questioned on direct examination and you told us that there \\n\\ncame a time when you received notice from an individual, I think it was person \\n\\nnumber 16, who told you, who told you that he was being prepped by 10 lawyers \\n\\nbefore he was about to testify in the Ruto and Sang case.    Do you recall that? \\n\\nA.      [14:46:25] Yes, I do. \\n\\nQ.      [14:46:26] Okay.    And you were walked through it by Mr Steynberg - very \\n\\nprofessionally, I might add - and so if you look at page 109 of the transcript on \\n\\nthe first day of the trial -- \\n\\n(Counsel confer)   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [14:46:54] So it\\'s 02/15/2022, from Tuesday.    Page 109.    Am I \\n\\ngetting it right?    Okay.    And ... okay.   \\n\\n17.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 99 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-052-Red-ENG CT WT 17-02-2022 100/113 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nQ.      [14:47:16] And so, anyway, you\\'re asked about this and you\\'re asked: \"And how \\n\\ndid [this] transpire?\"    This is on line 19:    \"How did [this] transpire?    Was it in \\n\\nperson -- was it an in-person meeting, was it a letter, a phone call, what happened?\"   \\n\\nSo he\\'s giving you multiple choice, in person, letter, phone call, A, B, C, which?    And \\n\\nyou say, \"In person.\"    Do you recall saying that? \\n\\nA.      [14:48:00] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [14:48:00] And so when you had this meeting with person number 16 about him \\n\\nbeing approached or him being, we would call it woodsheded, he was being -- he was \\n\\nbeing prepped by 10 lawyers, this was a tête-à-tête, that you were in person when he \\n\\ntold you this.   \\n\\nA.      [14:48:23] Repeat your question, please.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:48:25] When you -- in your testimony under oath you said that this was an \\n\\nin-person meeting that you had with person number 16 when he revealed that he was \\n\\ngoing to, or was -- had been prepared by 16 -- by -- by 10 lawyers? \\n\\nA.      [14:48:42] Yes, he informed me about it.   \\n\\nQ.      [14:48:45] I know he informed you about it.    But here you say in person.    So \\n\\ndo you stand by what you said under oath on Tuesday?   \\n\\nA.      [14:48:57] He inform -- he spoke to me one-to-one, not by writing, not by email. \\n\\nQ.      [14:49:04] Okay.    One-to-one.    Okay, so it wasn\\'t by phone call? \\n\\nA.      [14:49:07] No. \\n\\nQ.      [14:49:07] Okay.    All right.    That\\'s what I wanted.    Okay.    And now for \\n\\nthe record, on 16/09/2014, that individual was testifying here.     \\n\\nIt\\'s tab 80, your Honour, and I\\'m just going to -- this is just for reference \\n\\nthat -- because in order to give some context to the dates. \\n\\nWe see on line 9, on page 1, that it\\'s Tuesday, 16 September 2014.     \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n17.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 100 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-052-Red-ENG CT WT 17-02-2022 101/113 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nIf we look at the upper -- if we look at the next page, page -- well, page 63, we see on \\n\\nthat particular -- on that same day we see the witness who is now person 16 is \\n\\nabout -- is testifying.    That\\'s all I wanted for that. \\n\\nAnd then page -- tab 81, tab 81 we see that on Monday, 22 September 2014 is \\n\\nwhen -- and if we go to page 26 we see that is when he\\'s wished good luck.    In other \\n\\nwords, that is the last day of his testimony.     \\n\\nSo now, for context purposes, we have the first and the last date.    The last date being \\n\\n22 September, the first one being his testimony commencing on the 16th. \\n\\nAnd with that background, with that -- having set the stage on that, let\\'s look at tab 73.   \\n\\nTab 73.    And it\\'s 0144-0260.    And it\\'s dated 21 September 2014.    And if anyone \\n\\nwere to consult a -- a calendar, they would note that 21 September 2014 is a Sunday.   \\n\\nAnd the Court can take judicial notice by looking it up on Google. \\n\\nDo you recall being flown in, sir, to The Hague back on 21 September, or prior to that, \\n\\none or two days before that, 2014?    Do you recall that?   \\n\\nA.      [14:52:06] Yes. \\n\\nQ.

[14:52:22] You were flown in because of that conversation that you had with \\n\\nperson number 16? \\n\\nA.      [14:52:29] I am not sure about that. \\n\\nQ.      [14:52:31] Okay.    Okay.    Well let me help you out here. \\n\\nYou passed on that information to the victims and witness section, right?

[14:53:24] I did. \\n\\nQ.      [14:53:24] Did you do that directly or did you do it through VWU? \\n\\nA.      [14:53:29] Directly. \\n\\nQ.      [14:53:29] Directly.

[14:56:28] And then it\\'s at The Hague when you have this conversation more \\n\\nin-depth about what person number 16 had told you? \\n\\nA.      [14:56:38] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [14:56:38] Okay.    Now I would need the better part of the rest of the day to go \\n\\nthrough all of this.    But I\\'m going to put it to you and maybe -- and give you an \\n\\nopportunity to either retract or do something, but I have here several documents and \\n\\nI\\'ll read them in the record in any event, but these documents reveal the following, \\n\\nand I\\'m going to give you an opportunity to comment on this:    That you informed \\n\\nthem, you informed the -- the investigators, the ICC investigators through VWU that \\n\\nperson number 16 has called you, has called you and passed on this information.   \\n\\nAnd based on that, they\\'ve flown you to The Hague. \\n\\nNow, when you come to The Hague, lo and behold you left your phone behind.    But \\n\\nhey, you know, these investigators are tenacious, good on them, so they fly the phone.   \\n\\nThey have somebody go pick up the phone and they bring it to The Hague.    Then \\n\\nthere\\'s this whole issue about not having a -- a charger.    There\\'s this whole \\n\\ndiscussion in your presence until you finally say, \"Well, hey, I got a charger, it\\'s in \\n\\nmy -- my bag.    My wife packed it.\" \\n\\nBut then lo and behold they can\\'t get into the phone because it turns out that the SIM \\n\\ncard, you know, they don\\'t have the PIN.    And they are even telling you stop \\n\\nplaying with that because you\\'re going to block it.     \\n\\nAnd then after a whole day, and it\\'s a Sunday, we know it\\'s a Sunday because I just \\n\\nGoogled it, but also you remind the investigators that you had gone to church that \\n\\n17.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 104 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-052-Red-ENG CT WT 17-02-2022 105/113 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nday and you were probably the only black person because you didn\\'t see anybody \\n\\nelse at church and you were -- you were kind of, you know, dumbstruck that nobody \\n\\naround The Hague go to, you know, go to church on Sunday, at least not -- not young \\n\\npeople.    It\\'s all in here.    You don\\'t have to take my word, I\\'m going to read in \\n\\nthe record so the Court knows exactly where to go.    I\\'m trying to save time, you see. \\n\\nSo now, at the end of all of this, at the end of all of this, they essentially give up.    At \\n\\nthe end of the day they say, \"Hey, this is a total catastrophe.    We\\'re not going to get \\n\\ninto this phone.\"    Because what did they want you to do?    They wanted you to call \\n\\nperson number 16 and see whether he would reveal that information to you with \\n\\nthem tape-recording it.    Do you recall that now?   \\n\\nA.      [14:59:35] I didn\\'t -- I don\\'t remember the intentions, if those were the intentions.   \\n\\nBut I remember the incident where I -- because of the numerous telephones I heard \\n\\nand I -- I did not have a record of the SIM cards of the -- of the telephone with me.   \\n\\nAt the time I came here and I -- it is true I did not have the -- the PIN code of \\n\\nthe telephone. \\n\\nQ.      [15:00:01] And you did not have the number for number 16, you did not have \\n\\nthe number for number 4.    Remember, they were asking you whether even \\n\\nyou -- whether you would even call Mr Gicheru, and you backed off, you said, \"Oh, \\n\\nI can\\'t call him.    No, no, that would be too risky.\"    Do you recall any of that?   \\n\\nA.      [15:00:26] I recall that day when I have just explained. \\n\\nQ.      [15:00:30] All right.    Now one of the reasons they wanted to get into your \\n\\nphone and they had it flown in, aside from you telling them that you had received \\n\\na telephone call from person number 16, was so they could check it, they could check \\n\\nand see the number and see whether in fact this conversation had occurred.     \\n\\nAnd here\\'s my dilemma, now help me out here, you come to court and you say it was \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n17.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 105 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-052-Red-ENG CT WT 17-02-2022 106/113 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nan in-person meeting, and then we have all of these documents that show that you tell \\n\\nthem it\\'s this telephone conversation, they\\'re flying in a phone, and it would appear \\n\\nthat the entire situation was a charade.

[15:01:47] Your Honour, what we are discussing about took -- took place long \\n\\ntime ago.    And the information I am very sure about is that I was informed by this \\n\\nperson number 16 concerning the -- the availability of 10 lawyers because he was \\n\\nappearing on video -- on video -- on video in the country.    And I remember I -- I \\n\\ndiscussing with the -- with the investigators and informing them about \\n\\nthe information that was in my possession. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:02:28] All right.    Mr Witness, what the lawyer \\n\\nwants to know, this information you are talking about, about person number 16 being \\n\\ncounselled by 10 lawyers, how did you get that information?    Was it like you said \\n\\njust now, was it a face-to-face interaction with person number 16?    Did he tell you all \\n\\nthis information looking at you like I\\'m doing now, in your face?    Were you together \\n\\nwhen he gave you that information?    That is the question he\\'s asking.   \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [15:03:13] I remember he gave me the information face to face. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:03:17] Thank you. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:03:18] Okay.

We try to be very \\n\\nprepared for you, because this is a very convoluted story.    But I got the gist of it and \\n\\nso I\\'m just going to read the numbers in, and then hopefully in our final submission \\n\\nwe\\'ll try to piece it together.    But I just want to be on record that we are very, very \\n\\nmindful of the Court\\'s time and we don\\'t come here unprepared, we don\\'t come here \\n\\nunprepared. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:04:28] Well I don\\'t expect otherwise, Mr Karnavas.   \\n\\nAnd really do -- as I say, whatever you do, do it in the best interest of your client.   \\n\\nNobody\\'s pushing you. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:04:40] Okay.    So for the record it\\'s tab 73.    Tab 18.    Tab 71.   \\n\\nTab 74.    Tab 83.    Tab 84.    And -- and that\\'s it and these are ...   \\n\\nQ.      [15:05:22] And as I understand it, I\\'m being instructed to -- to remind you \\n\\nthat -- or to ask you whether all the -- all the documents that you ticked off you \\n\\nactually read.    Remember the very first day there was that chart and you ticked off \\n\\nthe documents that were sent to you.    You actually read those documents; is that \\n\\ncorrect?   \\n\\nA.      [15:05:46] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [15:05:46] Okay.

Okay?     \\n\\nCan I ask you, do you know why it was necessary for the OTP to question you over \\n\\nthree hours over a three-day period on that incident?    And if you don\\'t know, just \\n\\nsay \"I don\\'t know.\"   \\n\\nA.      [15:07:45] I don\\'t.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:07:46] Okay.    Now I just want to read some things to you, a couple of things, \\n\\nand -- because I think it\\'s important for the Court to also understand how this session \\n\\nwent about.    This is 12 July 2021.    It\\'s tab 54.    And I just want to touch on one -- one \\n\\nmatter.    I\\'m sure the Prosecution has a good explanation. \\n\\nDo you want to -- do you have it?    I don\\'t want you to feel like I\\'m tricking you. \\n\\nOkay, I\\'m looking at page 6 and that would be 0160-0286.    So this is page 6, line 194:   \\n\\n\"What I would like to do, and we would like to do is to remind you of your obligation \\n\\nto speak the truth.    This is a formal process.    We are representatives of \\n\\nthe International Criminal Court\".     \\n\\nNow mind you, present during this period when this is being read is none other than \\n\\nMr Steynberg, although he is not the speaker. \\n\\nIt goes on, starting with line 201:   \\n\\n\"In mine and in our experience over the years - yeah? - the people have a variety of \\n\\n17.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 108 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-052-Red-ENG CT WT 17-02-2022 109/113 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nreasons for not telling the whole truth or the part truth or in sometimes an absolute \\n\\nuntruth for a whole variety of reasons.

Do you understand?     \\n\\nI understand.\"     \\n\\nNow remember we began our sort of feisty exchange yesterday with me asking you if \\n\\nyou\\'re an honest person, and here it is, 12 July 2001, and they\\'re still asking you to be \\n\\ntruthful with them.   \\n\\nDid you get the sense, at least from that exchange, that they did not think that you \\n\\nwere a truthful person or at least had not been truthful with them at all times? \\n\\nA.      [15:10:49] That is not the case, because everyone who appears before them, \\n\\nI believe, is given the same warnings. \\n\\nQ.      [15:11:02] Okay.    All right.     \\n\\nSo we go on, line 207:   \\n\\n\"The reason ... I am reinforcing this and I think it would be fair to say - yeah? - it has \\n\\nbeen a few [things] -- a few highs and lows I think in our dealings with you and \\n\\nI don\\'t -- don\\'t mean any disrespect.    Because of that, it\\'s kind of ebb and flow a little \\n\\nbit like the tide going in and the tide going out.    Yeah?\"     \\n\\nAnd you say, \"Yeah.\"     \\n\\nLine 212: \"And ... but what we want to do is just put all that behind us.\"     \\n\\nNow, mind you, sir, you\\'ve already testified in the William -- in the -- in the Ruto and \\n\\nSang case.    And correct me if I\\'m wrong, from that period to this period, July, you \\n\\nhad no investigative role with them, or have you, and we\\'re unaware of it? \\n\\nA.      [15:12:12] No. \\n\\nQ.      [15:12:12] Okay.

But here they are and they\\'re saying, okay, if they want to put \\n\\nthings behind, all right. \\n\\n\"The reason why I am reinforcing this and I think it would be fair to say \\n\\n[that] - yeah? - it has been a few highs and lows\" okay, put it behind us.   \\n\\n\"... but what we want to do is put it all behind ... Yeah?    As I said, there is a whole \\n\\nvariety of reasons why people do think or act the way they do.    Most of the time, it\\'s \\n\\nself-preservation.    Yeah?    We think [it is] fear ...\" and so on. \\n\\nAnd then we go further down to 223, line 223:   \\n\\n\"If you\\'ve told us something before - yeah? - that is not correct, say so now during \\n\\n[the] process ... Because ... it\\'s a balancing act -- it\\'s a balancing act.    Yeah?

Do you understand what I mean?\"   \\n\\nDid you understand what they meant?   \\n\\nA.      [15:14:09] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:14:14] I can go on, but I put it to you, sir, that this was not some interview, \\n\\nthis was a proofing session where they were trying to give you opportunities and \\n\\nshow you documents in order for you to tailor, to tailor your memory and tailor your \\n\\nevidence and to iron out all the inconsistencies that they had discovered in \\n\\npreparation for this particular case.

And the Prosecutor has said that it was -- you know, it \\n\\nwas an interview.    I think it\\'s really between yourself and the Prosecutor.    I mean \\n\\nthe witness was just answering questions put to him, from what I see in the transcript \\n\\nbefore me, as in tab 54. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:15:06] Very well, your Honour.    I leave it to your discretion.   \\n\\nYou know, we\\'re going to argue this point, obviously, but I find it rather strange that \\n\\nall of a sudden they need to give this opportunity to this individual for no good \\n\\nreason, when they haven\\'t done any use of this person for so many years, to give him \\n\\nan opportunity to correct his record by showing him documents and cajoling him in \\n\\nsome ways as to what the right answers might be.    That\\'s the point that I\\'m trying to \\n\\nmake, that\\'s the point I will argue, and that\\'s why I think, in part, this person, along \\n\\nwith for other reasons that we have shown, is not to be believed.    And I rest -- I \\n\\nconclude my direct -- my cross-examination at this point. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:15:50] Thank you very much, Mr Karnavas. \\n\\nMr Steynberg, re-examination, please, if any.    You did indicate you want 15 minutes. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [15:16:00] I did, your Honour.    I have reconsidered that and I \\n\\nthink I may be able to curtail it.     \\n\\nBut just on that last point, your Honour, my learned friend has presented argument, \\n\\nand I know this is not the time for that, but the Prosecution obviously has obligations \\n\\nunder Article 54(1)(a) to test evidence, and we submit this is what we were doing, we \\n\\nwere testing the evidence to make sure that -- that we were satisfied with the versions \\n\\nbefore we called this witness.    And it was not about coaching, it was about doing our \\n\\nduty under the Statute. \\n\\nYour Honour, I had -- I had proposed to lead this witness again through the timelines \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n17.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 111 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-052-Red-ENG CT WT 17-02-2022 112/113 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nand the sequence of events.    And the reason for that was that when my learned \\n\\nfriend was cross-examining, particularly about the phones and phone calls, he was \\n\\njumping backwards and forwards from events that took place in 2013, 2014 and \\n\\ncomparing the two as if they were, in my submission, simultaneous events.    But \\n\\nhaving gone through the material again, I\\'m satisfied that the record is clear and \\n\\nspeaks for itself and I don\\'t need to actually lead the witness through that.     \\n\\nSo that being said, I have no further questions in re-examination. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:17:13] Thank you very much, Mr Steynberg. \\n\\nAnd I thank, I thank you all.

So other than that one lapse that you had that was brought up \\n\\nby Mr Steynberg yesterday where, in his own words, you lied to the investigators, \\n\\nother than that, on all your other dealings with the OTP, you were truthful?   \\n\\nA.      [9:36:58] Yes, my Honour.    And where there were issues within -- between me \\n\\nand the OTP, I well explained myself to them.   \\n\\nQ.      [9:37:10] Okay.    Well, if I may correct you a little bit.    I\\'m not an honour.    I\\'m \\n\\njust a lawyer.    So Madam President is her Honour, but I\\'m just -- you don\\'t need to \\n\\naddress me as \"my Honour\".    Just answer the question.   \\n\\nA.      [9:37:28] Thank you.    I -- I am answering my question to Madam President. \\n\\nQ.      [9:37:31] All right.    All right.    So again, to make sure that I\\'m absolutely clear, \\n\\non all your dealings with the Prosecution you were truthful? \\n\\nA.      [9:37:46] Yes, I am a truthful -- a truthful person. \\n\\nQ.

[9:37:53] And where there are issues, I am ready to explain myself.    And where \\n\\nI have done a mistake, I\\'m a person who is ready to apologise. \\n\\nQ.      [9:38:02] All right.    Okay.    Well, let me make sure I understand you correctly.   \\n\\nWhen you don\\'t tell the truth, you call it a mistake.    You apologise and then all is \\n\\nforgiven; is that what you\\'re telling me? \\n\\nA.      [9:38:14] To me, everything I apologise for I expect not -- my -- my intention is to \\n\\nbe honest. \\n\\nQ.      [9:38:28] Okay.   \\n\\nA.      [9:38:28] And it has been my intention throughout this case to be honest enough \\n\\nto -- to -- to this court. \\n\\nQ.      [9:38:38] All right.    And so I take it that the individuals that were mentioned in \\n\\npassing by Mr Steynberg yesterday that have accused you or have asserted, I should \\n\\nsay, that you provided them with information in order for them to lie to the OTP \\n\\neither to get on to the victims protection section or become part of the organisation, as \\n\\nyou call it.    Those people are lying?   \\n\\nA.      [9:39:11] Please repeat your question. \\n\\nQ.      [9:39:14] All right.    Yesterday, Mr Steynberg asked you a question concerning \\n\\nwhat others have said about you, that you have provided them with false information, \\n\\nyou\\'ve helped them confabulate, manufacture falsehoods in order to pass them \\n\\non -- pass themselves on as witnesses for the Prosecution.   \\n\\nA.      [9:39:48] Personally, my Honour, I am not aware of such incidences.    And to \\n\\nthe best of my knowledge, I have not manufactured or coached or -- or done anything \\n\\nwhatsoever to implicate anyone in this -- in -- I mean, to coach anyone in order to \\n\\nappear here as a -- as a witness. \\n\\nQ.      [9:40:21] All right.    That\\'s your answer.

[9:40:31] They will be lying, my Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [9:40:33] All right.    And I take it if they\\'re lying, they\\'re liars? \\n\\nA.      [9:40:36] I have not finished my answer. \\n\\nQ.      [9:40:38] Oh, I apologise.   \\n\\nA.      [9:40:41] My Honour, I come from a country where those in question can do \\n\\nanything in order to protect themselves.    They might influence even witnesses.    As \\n\\nevident to this case, what personally I underwent as a witness of this Court, I was able \\n\\nto speak to the accused person in this Court, and having done things against what I \\n\\nintended before.    So the counsel here knows exactly that people like his client are \\n\\nable to get even witnesses to come to this court and provide false information, such as \\n\\nwhat the counsel is asking me.    And on that matter, to the best of my knowledge, I \\n\\nwant to say that I have not coached anyone in order to become a witness of this court.   \\n\\nQ.      [9:42:23] All right.    That\\'s a complete answer now. \\n\\nSo yesterday when Mr Steynberg said that that\\'s exactly what number 7 said, that you \\n\\nand number 18 did exactly that, number 7 would be lying; is that right?    Yes or no?   \\n\\nA.      [9:42:46] I hope -- I have to answer your question, not to direct me how I will \\n\\nanswer it, my counsel. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:42:57] Maybe -- sorry -- sorry, Mr Karnavas.     \\n\\nMaybe if we ask the witness, do you have the list before you where Mr Steynberg \\n\\nreferred to a number 7, if at all, yesterday so you will be guided as to, you know, who \\n\\nexactly Mr Karnavas is talking about?    Do you have the list before you? \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [9:43:26] I don\\'t have any list today.   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [9:43:33] Well, let\\'s get him a list.   \\n\\nQ.

Is he lying?    Yes or no?   \\n\\nA.      [9:44:23] If number 7 said so, he is lying.   \\n\\nQ.      [9:44:28] And you\\'re telling the truth?   \\n\\nA.      [9:44:32] Solemnly the truth. \\n\\nQ.      [9:44:35] Okay.    Thank you. \\n\\nNow let\\'s look at some statistics before we move on.    The statistics I want to go \\n\\nthrough are the number of times you\\'ve spoken with the Prosecution.     \\n\\nNow, the Court will have all the documentation in front of it and the Prosecution can \\n\\ncorrect me, they can do their own calculation, but it seems to me that you\\'ve spoken \\n\\nto the OTP approximately 58 times.    You were questioned for -- over periods of \\n\\n43 days for more than 164 hours.    Does that sound about right?   \\n\\nA.      [9:45:26] Your Honour, I have done -- I have not done such calculation, but I\\'m \\n\\naware I have appeared and gave statements to the officers of this Court at different \\n\\ntimes.    But personally I have no -- any statistics whatsoever.    What I know is that I \\n\\nhave given my -- the statements to -- to the officers of this Court on several occasions. \\n\\nQ.      [9:46:02] All right.    Thank you. \\n\\nAnd it seems that -- we have the list from yesterday of all the documents that you \\n\\nwere shown.    You ticked them off during the six-day session that you were with \\n\\nthe Prosecution, which we\\'ll get to.    It seems that you have generated approximately \\n\\n734 pages of evidence.    Would that be about right, the amount of pages that you \\n\\nreviewed over the period of six days plus since you\\'ve been here? \\n\\nA.

[9:47:08] Thank you.

[9:47:24] I confirm I have done the sessions and offered the paper that -- that \\n\\nwas here yesterday that I gave my ticks, and I have no objection to have done \\n\\nthe -- the exercise that was -- that I did last -- last week. \\n\\nQ.      [9:47:50] Okay.    You call it an exercise.    Can you explain how that exercise \\n\\nwent.   \\n\\nA.      [9:48:06] My Honour, I was given the documents that have been accepted in this \\n\\nCourt as exhibits.    And I went through them, read, and after finishing every \\n\\ndocument I underwent -- I had to put a tick to ensure, to confirm that I have looked at \\n\\nit and I have read it. \\n\\nQ.      [9:48:44] Now this wasn\\'t the first time that you were proofed in this case.   \\n\\nThere was an earlier session when you were proofed.    Do you recall that?

Well, it was the summertime when they flew you in here and \\n\\nthey spent three -- three days discussing your evidence.    Do you recall that?   \\n\\nA.

I was brought here and I looked and asked \\n\\nquestions concerning the statements that I had given to the court officer.   \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 7 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 8/117 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nQ.

And by my calculation they spoke to you, or you spoke to \\n\\nthem, for a little bit over 10 hours - would that be right - over a period of three days?   \\n\\nA.      [9:50:31] I confirm it was three days.    I did not calculate the number of hours.   \\n\\nQ.      [9:50:36] All right.    By my calculation, during that three-day period, those \\n\\nnine -- 10 plus hours, approximately 30 per cent of the time was spent going over this \\n\\nincident that happened back in -- on (Redacted); is that -- does that ring a bell?   \\n\\nA.      [9:51:10] Yes, it does. \\n\\nQ.      [9:51:12] Okay.    So something that during the proofing session in the Ruto and \\n\\nSang case when Mr Steynberg said, well, I can understand that explanation that you \\n\\ngave then, it was necessary for the Prosecution to bring you here before the charges \\n\\nwere confirmed in this case so they could iron out your answers concerning that \\n\\nparticular event.   \\n\\nA.      [9:51:51] My Honour, it is my duty and was my duty to accept the call of this \\n\\nCourt whenever they asked me to appear.    The protocol of when, how and who shall \\n\\ndo that is not under my powers.    I would like to add that what I understand is that \\n\\nthis Court have efficient officers, qualified, proven that they can do their work as \\n\\nrequired by law.    And therefore, I want to make it clear that the intentions of \\n\\nthe officers who brought me at that time was to ensure that they bring to this Court \\n\\nevidences that they have looked into and that I have also provided -- that I agree also \\n\\nto have provided to the better of my knowledge that they are the true evidences.   \\n\\nAnd therefore, as a witness, I cannot get -- I cannot get into how the ICC offers their \\n\\nservices or does its work because I believe and trust to the officers that are working \\n\\nunder this Court.   \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 8 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 9/117 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nQ.      [9:54:04] Mr Witness, I\\'m not suggesting that you called them up.    They called \\n\\nyou.    That\\'s what I\\'m -- and I\\'m trying to verify that whether during that three-day \\n\\nperiod they were going over an incident that occurred back on 20 July 2013, which \\n\\nMr Steynberg had said in the proofing session in the Ruto and Sang case, well, that he \\n\\nunderstood the reasons why you failed to mention that before.    I just want that \\n\\nverification that three days, three hours were spent covering that particular issue \\n\\nduring that -- that prepping session, that proofing session.    Because that\\'s what it \\n\\nwas, it was a proofing session, it wasn\\'t an interview.    That\\'s what I\\'m suggesting.   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [9:54:59] Is there a question there, your Honour? \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [9:55:02] Yes, there is. \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [9:55:03] My Honour.   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [9:55:05] It sounded very much like argument from -- from \\n\\nthe bar to me, your Honour. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:55:11] Yes, Mr Witness, answer the question, \\n\\nplease. \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [9:55:15] My Honour, to the best of my knowledge, the counsel is \\n\\nnot asking me any question.    He\\'s trying to suggest how the ICC is supposed to \\n\\nwork instead of asking me sufficient questions.    I beg your protection, \\n\\nMadam President, that I am not brought into arguments on how ICC shall work.   \\n\\nInstead, I am guided on what I have taken oath to do concerning this case.    I am \\n\\nready to solemnly say the truth, to the best of my knowledge, concerning the issues \\n\\nthat I have called to do on my desk as a witness. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:56:09] Yes, Mr Witness, be assured that you\\'re \\n\\nprotected by the Court.    Be calm, do not feel intimidated.    I\\'m sure you\\'re not.   \\n\\nThe Defence counsel, Mr Karnavas, is merely doing his job.

He is reminding you about a meeting of 2013, on 20 July.    And what he \\n\\nwants to know is whether or not when you were called last summer, when you came \\n\\nhere for those three days, three hours were spent with you by the Prosecutors or \\n\\ninvestigators asking you as to whether or not -- or for you to tell what happened \\n\\nduring the meeting or whatever happened on 20 July 2013 that you know about.   \\n\\nThat is basically his question. \\n\\nAm I correct, Mr Karnavas? \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [9:57:16] Absolutely.    I couldn\\'t have said it better, your Honour. \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [9:57:23] I confirm I discussed that matter.    I don\\'t remember or \\n\\ndid I do any calculation of time, dear Counsel. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [9:57:33] \\n\\nQ.      [9:57:34] All right.

[10:11:23] So yesterday you said when questioned why you lied, you said that \\n\\nyou were in fear and you had to make up something on the spot.    Do you recall \\n\\nsaying that?   \\n\\nA.      [10:11:44] I said I covered my friend.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:11:48] You covered your friend.    But then you said that you -- you weren\\'t \\n\\nexpecting to be questioned that way and so you had to make a spontaneous -- give \\n\\na spontaneous explanation and that\\'s why -- that\\'s why you lied, it was spontaneous?   \\n\\nA.      [10:12:08] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:12:10] So it wasn\\'t something that you had thought of before, it was \\n\\nsomething that just came to you out of instinct, self-preservation, fear, you needed to \\n\\nsort of come up with a story and lo and behold there was number 7.    You knew he \\n\\nhad withdrawn, or you had heard about it, and so he\\'s an easy target, let\\'s mention \\n\\nhim, put him into the picture and that would be the end of the story, right?   \\n\\nA.      [10:12:41] I knew I was bound to come back and -- and tell -- and tell the truth. \\n\\nQ.      [10:12:48] But that wasn\\'t my question, now, was it?    We\\'re going to get to you \\n\\nwere bound to tell the truth.    Now, I\\'m asking you if I have it right, that this was \\n\\nsomething spontaneous that you thought up right on the spot.    You were being \\n\\npressed, you said, hey, okay, this person is the one, right? \\n\\nA.      [10:13:10] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [10:13:10] Okay.

[10:15:48] When I was given a call I didn\\'t -- I didn\\'t know I was being recorded. \\n\\nQ.      [10:15:51] Okay.    They did tell you, however, that you were a suspect.    They \\n\\nviewed you as a suspect.   \\n\\nA.      [10:16:02] On the call?   \\n\\nQ.      [10:16:03] Yeah, on the call.    We\\'re going to go through it right now.    Now, \\n\\nyou can say \"I don\\'t remember\".    That\\'s a good -- that\\'s a safe one? \\n\\nA.      [10:16:10] Indeed I don\\'t remember. \\n\\nQ.      [10:16:12] Okay.    Good.    All right.     \\n\\nWell, let\\'s go through this.    And now I\\'m going to refer to -- I\\'m referring to -- it\\'s on \\n\\ntab 29.    It\\'s KEN-OTP-0145-0439.    That\\'s the beginning.

I\\'m going to be reading a whole lot, so \\n\\nit might -- he might want to get to the binder itself because we went to the trouble to \\n\\nget it for him.    But I\\'m going to be starting with line 43.   \\n\\nSo it\\'s tab 29, the first page should be 0145-0439, dated 14 March 2014.    Yeah, tab 29.   \\n\\nThat\\'s what I\\'m told, so I\\'m telling you. \\n\\nYou don\\'t have a copy.    Okay. \\n\\nMS TERZIEVA:    [10:18:49] (Microphone not activated) your Honour, may -- may I \\n\\ninterrupt for a moment? \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:18:58] Yeah, what do you want to say?   \\n\\nMS TERZIEVA:    [10:19:01] In light of the Trial Chamber decision of yesterday, I \\n\\nwonder whether this line of questioning shouldn\\'t be in private session. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:19:08] No. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:19:09] Well, I was going to ask Mr Karnavas, or \\n\\nadvise that when he thinks that we should go into private session he lets \\n\\nthe court officer know. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:19:20] Yes, your Honour.    As far as I\\'m aware of, I\\'m not \\n\\ngoing to be going into anything that should be kept from the public.    And nothing \\n\\nthat will reveal this particular gentleman\\'s -- and I will be very slow about this and \\n\\nmethodical.    I\\'m very mindful of his security concerns.    And we may disagree on \\n\\npositions, but I\\'m very mindful of that.   \\n\\nSo, now, if we could --   \\n\\nQ.      [10:19:54] Do you have the -- do you have that page?

Well, I don\\'t want to take charge of the Court, but you \\n\\ncould -- the gentleman can relax a little bit, the court officer. \\n\\nThank you very much. \\n\\nOkay.    So let\\'s start with line 43. \\n\\n\"OK\" -- this is the interviewer, interviewer 1, by the way.    On the first page you\\'ll see \\n\\nwho it is.    No name, but it\\'s an OTP investigator. \\n\\n\"OK.    The other thing is, when we do this, I\\'m going to ... we are going to interview \\n\\non tape, OK?\"   \\n\\nAnswer, that\\'s you, \"Yes\".   \\n\\nInterviewer:    \"The reason being we want\" - I\\'m sorry, I\\'ll have to slow down a little \\n\\nbit - \"The reason being we want you -- we want your full honesty this time, and we \\n\\nwant to tell us -- and we want you to tell us the complete truth.    So, what we are \\n\\ngoing to do is record our interview with you.\" \\n\\nAnswer:    \"Yes.\"   \\n\\nLet me pause.    Does that ring a bell?    Is it coming back to you?    Because I know it \\n\\nwas foggy, initially, but is it coming back? \\n\\nA.      [10:21:27] Yeah. \\n\\nQ.      [10:21:27] Okay.    Good. \\n\\nSo we go on, line 49:   \\n\\n\" ... and what that means is ... at the moment we have information that you also may \\n\\nhave interfered with other witnesses.    So we want to talk to you about that, even \\n\\nthough we are after those most responsible, but we would like to interview you about \\n\\nyour role and the role of others.

At this point, the next line they ask you whether you want -- whether \\n\\nyou want a lawyer.   \\n\\n\"You may need to have a lawyer present\". \\n\\nLine 57:    \"But I want you to think about [it]\".   \\n\\nI\\'m going to pause here for a second.    They\\'re asking you to think about it.    All \\n\\nright. \\n\\nAnd then on line 60 or 59:   \\n\\n\"I have to -- I have to give you some warnings, but we still need your continued \\n\\nassistance, but you need to be one hundred per cent honest\" and me and this \\n\\nindividual \"because we already have information that you also, after you left us, were \\n\\ninvolved in witness tampering.    So if you do come to us, you have to be completely \\n\\nhonest with us, otherwise I am not interested in talking to you.\" \\n\\nNow let me pause here.    You told us earlier that you have been honest with \\n\\nthe Prosecution except this one itty-bitty time that had to do with something else.    It \\n\\nhad to do with a recording, a clandestine, unauthorised recording. \\n\\nDo these warnings -- we haven\\'t even started yet, but so far, do you get \\n\\nthe impression that the OTP investigators see you as an honest person?    Because that \\n\\nwas my first question and you said, yes, you are an honest.    Do they see you as an \\n\\nhonest person thus far?    If counsel needs to object, she can object, you know, she\\'s \\n\\ngetting all exited.    Go ahead, object. \\n\\nMS TERZIEVA:    [10:24:01] Yes.    I\\'m sorry to interrupt again. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:24:04] Mr Karnavas, turn your mic off please.   \\n\\nMr Karnavas. \\n\\nMS TERZIEVA:    [10:24:08] I\\'m sorry to interrupt again, your Honour, but this line of \\n\\nquestioning is entering into a territory which, in my view, is covered by \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 22 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 23/117 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nthe Trial Chamber decision of yesterday.    So I would respectfully request that we go \\n\\ninto private session.    I don\\'t know what the witness will answer and how things will \\n\\nunfold, but out of an abundance of caution I would request that we go into private \\n\\nsession for -- for this line of questioning. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:24:30] May I be heard?    May I be heard? \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:24:34] Please, Mr Karnavas. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:24:35] Just because the individual lied and was dishonest, as \\n\\nwe will see, doesn\\'t mean that he\\'s going to be charged.    He hasn\\'t been charged thus \\n\\nfar.    What I\\'m trying to establish is, because now his character for honesty is at issue.   \\n\\nSo I\\'m -- I think it\\'s perfectly fair, it is perfectly fair to go through all of \\n\\nthe admonitions put to him and why they thought he had been less than truthful, in \\n\\nfact, why he had lied to them. \\n\\nNow -- relax for a second. \\n\\nNow, if we want to go into private session, I have no problem in going -- doing this \\n\\nentire trial in private session, but if the Prosecution is going to bring this individual \\n\\nhere and this person is going to be giving speeches about how he was threatened and \\n\\nhow this and how that, and I\\'m not able to let the public also know that this person is \\n\\na first-class confabulator, then I think it\\'s not a fair -- an open public -- trial.    But I am \\n\\nwilling to go private if that\\'s what -- you know, it will save us some time and it saves \\n\\ncounsel from having to jump up and down and -- I can see her finger being itchy \\n\\nevery so often, making me nervous. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [10:25:53] Your Honour, if I may, on this point I would \\n\\nactually -- the Prosecution would support the request of Rule 74 counsel.    The issue \\n\\nis not the honesty of the witness, but the issue is that the subject matter being \\n\\ndiscussed and what\\'s being put to the witness in this interview by the interviewers is \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 23 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 24/117 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nhis alleged involvement in witness tampering.    Answers to that, and I don\\'t \\n\\nknow -- also don\\'t know what answer he will give, but answers to that question may \\n\\nindeed invoke issues related to Rule 74.    So for this -- for this part of the questioning, \\n\\nI would request we go into private session, your Honour. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:26:26] Yes.    Well, Mr Karnavas has not really \\n\\ntouched on that.    I cannot tell what the witness\\'s answer would be to Mr Karnavas\\'s \\n\\nquestions or concerns.    If the subject of the witness in his answer were to touch on \\n\\nhim interfering with other witnesses, then I agree we have to go into private session. \\n\\nAs I say, I do not -- I do not know what his answer would be or what he wants to say, \\n\\nbut if he were really to say that he -- you know, to state his role interfering with other \\n\\nwitnesses, you know, thus incriminating him, then I\\'m afraid we\\'ll have to go into \\n\\nprivate session.   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:27:19] Madam President -- relax, relax for a second.     \\n\\nMadam President, I will endeavour to tiptoe around the issue of that and get all \\n\\nthe other ammunitions -- admonitions that are being given to the gentleman.   \\n\\nTherefore, counsel here need not worry that anything untoward will come out, you \\n\\nknow, during the presentation that the Prosecutor may latch on to and prosecute him \\n\\nas a result. \\n\\nSo if I may proceed. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:27:53] Well, he\\'s given the assurances.    You know, \\n\\nnobody was going -- was saying that he would be prosecuted.    For what? \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:28:01] I don\\'t know.    That\\'s it.    So -- \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:28:03] Mr Karnavas, just a moment.    I see \\n\\nthe witness raising his hand.     \\n\\nDo you want to say anything, Mr Witness? \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 24 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 25/117 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [10:28:09] Yes, your Honour.    I have two things to say, your \\n\\nHonour.    One is that the counsel keep referring me as a liar, even though it is his \\n\\nline of asking questions.    I will request that the counsel respect my integrity because \\n\\nif I was a liar all the information that I have brought to this court will not be here.   \\n\\nBut the information I brought to this Court is of substance.    That\\'s why we are \\n\\ndiscussing about it today. \\n\\nNumber two, my Honour, is that it\\'s my request that when I\\'m being asked questions \\n\\nof this manner, of this subject where it involves where I will mention others, that we \\n\\ntake the subject to the private session as put forward by the lawyers in this Court.   \\n\\nThank you. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:30:00] All right.    In respect of your first concern, \\n\\nMr Witness, you know, counsel calling you a liar, I would really ask that, you know, \\n\\nyou calm down.    Remember yesterday -- during your testimony yesterday you gave \\n\\ncertain instances, and including even this morning, where you said I said this but \\n\\nthen I meant this.    So you lied?    That was the question by the Prosecutor.    And to \\n\\nsum, you answered yes and gave your reasons.    I\\'m sure counsel does not mean to, \\n\\nyou know, demean you in any way or to, you know, cast aspersions on your integrity.   \\n\\nSo just calm down and answer the questions.    If calm down and just answer his \\n\\nquestions, you know, then things will be smooth. \\n\\nAs to -- I don\\'t know, as I say, whether or not you\\'ll be, you know, mentioning names \\n\\nin respect -- in respect of his assumption that you interfered also with other witnesses.     \\n\\nAnd if that is your position, then, as I said, Mr Karnavas, I think we should go into \\n\\nprivate session, okay?

Thank you, Madam President.    I\\'m \\n\\na little rusty, so apologies. \\n\\nQ.      [10:42:52] All right.    Now -- so you had the phone call on the 14th, now it\\'s 25th \\n\\nso, if my math is correct, you had 11 days to think about it.    Because they told you, \\n\\nthink about it, come only if you\\'re going to tell us the truth, the whole truth and \\n\\nnothing but the truth, right?    And you had 11 days to think about, you thought \\n\\nabout it and that\\'s why you went, right? \\n\\nA.      [10:43:16] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [10:43:18] Okay.    Now we\\'re going to get to the -- the lie.    But before that, I\\'m \\n\\ngoing to put to you this, that that lie that you said earlier was spontaneous that you \\n\\nsaid yesterday it just, you know, you were overwhelmed by the fear of these -- these \\n\\ninvestigators, that was actually a lie, that you lied yesterday on the stand when you \\n\\nsaid it was spontaneous, and today.    Because I suggested -- I put to you, sir, that \\n\\nduring that 11-day period you were getting your ducks in a row for your lie and you \\n\\nwere thinking of a very creative lie to give to the Prosecutors, that you had no \\n\\nintention, no intention of telling them the full truth.    What do you say?   \\n\\nA.      [10:44:11] That is not the matter. \\n\\nQ.      [10:44:16] Okay.    Now let\\'s go to the document and let\\'s see how this interview \\n\\nbegins.     \\n\\nAnd I think this is important, your Honour, because it goes, again, to show, one, his \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 31 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 32/117 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nintentions, and also those of the investigators, in answering the question as to \\n\\nwhether they put him in fear and what have you. \\n\\nSo now I\\'m looking at tab 30.    Now you\\'re going to have to go to tab 30.    Now you \\n\\nknow how to do it so we don\\'t have to have anybody assist you.    I\\'m looking at \\n\\nKEN-0 -- KEN-OTP-0135-0041.    That\\'s the first page.    It says 25 March 2014, track 1.   \\n\\nAnd we\\'ll start at 0135-0047.    So if you look at that document and you go to \\n\\npage number 6, that\\'s probably the easiest way to find it. \\n\\nAnd I\\'m going to start with line 211.    And when you get there let us know.   \\n\\nA.      [10:45:36] Page 6, 211, I\\'m there. \\n\\nQ.      [10:45:39] You\\'re there.    Good. \\n\\nAll right.    So interviewer 1.    And it looks like, if we look at the first page, the two \\n\\ninterviewers are the same that were in the previous conversation, the telephone \\n\\nconversation that you had.    So we\\'re not going to mention names.     \\n\\nSo anyway, interview 1 goes:     \\n\\n\"OK.    I\\'m going to ask you because the situation is very serious, I\\'m going to ask, \\n\\nwe\\'re going to record everything that you say but I need your full and frank honesty \\n\\nin everything you tell me.\"   \\n\\nAnd you say, line 214: \"Yes, of course.    Yes.\" \\n\\nLet me stop right here.    I take it you understood the question that was posed to you \\n\\nby the interviewer and that\\'s why you answered \"Yes, of course.    Yes.\"   \\n\\nA.      [10:46:32] They required me to say the truth and I answered an affirmative. \\n\\nQ.      [10:46:36] Well, that\\'s a different -- that\\'s a -- well, I didn\\'t ask you whether \\n\\nthey -- I\\'m asking you did you understand the question? \\n\\nA.      [10:46:43] Yes, the (Overlapping speakers). \\n\\nQ.      [10:46:45] Okay.    And so when you said, \"Yes, of course, yes\", you knew exactly \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 32 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 33/117 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nwhat was expected of you? \\n\\nA.      [10:46:51] Exactly. \\n\\nQ.      [10:46:52] Okay.    Now, 215, line 215: \"This is very serious.\"     \\n\\nAnd then they talk about, you know, they\\'re looking at your security \"and I need you \\n\\nto be completely honest\".    Because as you told us yesterday, there was almost a quid \\n\\npro quo, you wanted security and had something from them.    They wanted \\n\\nsomething from you, you wanted something from them, right?    You wanted them to \\n\\nassist you with your security situation and that\\'s why you called them back to say can \\n\\nI come back into the fold, into the company.    And they said yes, but you got to tell us \\n\\nthe truth.    Am I putting it right? \\n\\nA.      [10:47:35] Yes, indeed. \\n\\nQ.      [10:47:36] Okay.    So -- so they say: \"I suspect that you\\'re -- OK, I\\'m going to be \\n\\nup front with you as well.\"    No hidden agendas.   \\n\\n\"I suspect that you -- you\\'ve been potentially playing both sides on the same point, \\n\\nOK?\"    You understood what he meant by \"both sides\"?   \\n\\nA.      [10:48:03] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [10:48:03] Okay.    And then he goes on:   \\n\\n\"That doesn\\'t matter and I\\'m not really concerned about that.    What I\\'m concerned \\n\\nabout is this security threat and we have to address it.    So I want you to be full and \\n\\nfrank with me ... I want you to be open and to tell me the full truth because it is going \\n\\nto be very difficult for us to move and to do anything for you if you\\'re full and frank \\n\\nwith me ...\"     \\n\\nDo you see that?   \\n\\nA.      [10:48:39] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:48:39] Okay.    And then it goes on: \"You just need to know, all right?

That\\'s a question.    I had an inflection at the end.   \\n\\nA.      [10:49:22] What\\'s the question please?   \\n\\nQ.      [10:49:24] The question is when they were telling you these things, when he says \\n\\nthat \"this is not a trick question\", this is not -- I\\'m not trying to trick you, they\\'re \\n\\nsaying if we\\'re going to try and help you, you have to be full and frank with us, okay?   \\n\\nWhen they were saying that and they actually were -- were they not on your side, \\n\\nwere they not trying to help you?   \\n\\nA.      [10:49:40] I said I was also observing their body language.    The people I met \\n\\nbefore -- this was not the first time I had met the investigators and I observed their \\n\\nbody language.    The way they were expressing themselves was quite different with \\n\\nthe previous occasions, that\\'s why I had my fears. \\n\\nQ.      [10:50:01] Okay.   \\n\\nA.      [10:50:02] But after a little time, I was comfortable and we went on with our \\n\\ndiscussion. \\n\\nQ.      [10:50:12] All right.    Okay.    Can you just explain to me, what do you mean by \\n\\n\"body language\"?    I mean, what was it?    Were they flexing their muscles, doing \\n\\nsomething?    You know, like breaking pencils?    What exactly were they doing that \\n\\nwere giving you this impression that somehow they were out to get you -- to arrest \\n\\nyou and to put you in fear.    Please describe that for us so we can have the full \\n\\npicture.   \\n\\nA.

At times they were -- they were not \\n\\nas much as friendly as they used to be.    I found some differences. \\n\\nQ.      [10:51:02] Okay.

So you were talking \\n\\nabout your security situation in that, right? \\n\\nA.      [10:52:53] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [10:52:54] Okay.    And that\\'s one of the reasons -- that was the motivating factor \\n\\nthat you had decided that you were going to go there and this time you\\'re going to \\n\\ntell them the truth, right?   \\n\\nA.      [10:53:07] That\\'s one of the reasons. \\n\\nQ.      [10:53:08] Okay.    To save some time I\\'m not going to -- I\\'ll skip the rest because \\n\\nthe name is there, but let\\'s go into the next page, which is 0135-0051.    And I\\'ll -- if \\n\\nyou could focus your attention on line 366, it says: \"I would like to interview, but it\\'s \\n\\na formal interview, a full and frank interview with you about your involvement as \\n\\nwell as who\\'s instructed you, give you the opportunity to hear what evidence that we \\n\\nhave in the witness intimidation case.\"     \\n\\nDo you see that?   \\n\\nA.      [10:54:03] Yes, I do. \\n\\nQ.      [10:54:04] In other words, the investigators were prepared to provide you with \\n\\nsome information about what they knew, hoping that you would be truthful with \\n\\nthem.    So, in other words, they had some information, they were going to share it \\n\\nwith you, and they were hoping that you would share with them your information so \\n\\nthat maybe they could can have a complete picture, right? \\n\\nA.      [10:54:31] Yes, of which I did after the end of the three days. \\n\\nQ.      [10:54:35] We\\'ll get to that.    Trust me.    I\\'m going to allow you to speak as \\n\\nmuch as you went when we get to that part.    I just want to get through this.   \\n\\nSo when we get to 372, line 372:    \"As I said before, I want you to be open to us.    And \\n\\nit will be a tell-all.\"    A tell-all.

By this point, you already had \\n\\nthat -- that -- clandestine, that unauthorised interview, had you not, back on \\n\\n(Redacted), right?   \\n\\nA.      [10:55:36] I don\\'t understand. \\n\\nQ.      [10:55:37] This is -- this interview here is after, since we\\'re in March 2014, and \\n\\nthey\\'re saying this is a tell-all.    The unauthorised -- the unauthorised meeting that \\n\\nyou had on (Redacted), do you think at that stage that was also part of the tell-all and \\n\\nthat you should have volunteered that information?    It\\'s a yes or a no.   \\n\\nA.      [10:56:12] Yes, they were still continuing with the investigation. \\n\\nQ.      [10:56:15] Right.    And again, not to get ahead of myself, it wasn\\'t until \\n\\nthe proofing session, the proofing session in the Ruto and Sang case months later after \\n\\nmany, many discussions with you that the OTP brought it to your attention and said, \\n\\nhey, by the way, we noticed here that you had this secret meeting, it was they who \\n\\nbrought it up, right?   \\n\\nA.      [10:56:43] The same matter I had already discussed earlier on even before that \\n\\ntime.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:56:47] You had discussed your unauthorised --   \\n\\nA.      [10:56:52] With the investigators during our -- our -- during the time when I was \\n\\ndoing the -- the recording and I handed over the recordings to the investigators.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:57:01] Okay.    Let me --   \\n\\nA.      [10:57:01] At that time, I was -- the recordings were all given -- \\n\\nQ.

[10:57:01] And, therefore, I spoke about the recording not in -- during this time \\n\\nyou are talking about only.

[10:57:24] You asked me if I have -- I have spoken about the recording before. \\n\\nQ.      [10:57:28] Sir, sir, if I may, just answer this question.    The Prosecutor brought it \\n\\nto your attention, and it was Mr Steynberg who was present and we have the video, \\n\\nwe may even get to see it, where he\\'s raising it for the very first time that, hey, by \\n\\nthe way, we just discovered that you had this unauthorised meeting.    It was them \\n\\nthat brought it to your attention and not you the other way around.    And I\\'m not \\n\\nsuggesting that you didn\\'t turn over the tapes.    I\\'m suggesting you never revealed \\n\\nthat you had a meeting with that gentleman on that particular --   \\n\\nA.      [10:58:09] To who?   \\n\\nQ.      [10:58:10] To the Prosecution, to the investigators.   \\n\\nA.      [10:58:12] To the investigators?   \\n\\nQ.      [10:58:13] Yes.   \\n\\nA.      [10:58:16] If we may look in the records --   \\n\\nQ.      [10:58:18] Is it yes or no? \\n\\nA.      [10:58:19] Excuse me. \\n\\nQ.      [10:58:20] Okay.    Go ahead.   \\n\\nA.      [10:58:22] If you may look, if you may take your time to look into the documents \\n\\nof when -- when I handed over the recording, all the information you are asking me \\n\\nabout was discussed then.    It was during this time that we were meeting -- at the \\n\\nmeeting you are talking about, that we -- we also spoke about. \\n\\nQ.      [10:58:49] Okay.   \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 38 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 39/117 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nA.      [10:58:49] And I was invited to speak about it by the -- by the -- by \\n\\nthe Prosecution during that time, but it does not mean that it was the first time that \\n\\nI was discussing about that matter.   \\n\\nQ.      [10:59:00] All right.    I just want to make sure, under oath -- \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:59:05] Mr Karnavas, I think this a good time to \\n\\nbreak. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:59:09] Can I just get this one last question in, your Honour. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:59:13] Okay.    Please, yes. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:59:13] \\n\\nQ.      [10:59:14] Okay.    I just want to make sure, I want to commit you to this, help \\n\\nme out here.    Under oath you\\'re saying that you actually brought it to their attention, \\n\\nnot just giving them the tape, you actually discussed that meeting that you had with \\n\\nthat gentleman on (Redacted), that unauthorised meeting.    Okay.    Now, if -- now, \\n\\nlet me finish.    If you need time to think about that before you answer it, we can take \\n\\nthe break, because you\\'re getting into dangerous territory.    I\\'m just telling you right \\n\\nnow.   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:59:44] It\\'s not just about even the meeting.   \\n\\nMaybe the witness needs to know - and that would be in private session - which \\n\\ngentleman you are talking about.    Maybe he needs to refresh his memory.

[11:33:04] Sir, did you have an opportunity to think about the question that I \\n\\nposed? \\n\\nA.      [11:33:13] Please pose again the question. \\n\\nQ.      [11:33:15] Does that mean that you didn\\'t think about it? \\n\\nA.      [11:33:19] I requested that you pose again the question. \\n\\nQ.      [11:33:21] I understand what you requested, and I -- I posed the question, and \\n\\nI -- you were given an opportunity to think about your answer over the last \\n\\n30 minutes. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [11:33:31] And remember, Mr Karnavas, I\\'d asked that, \\n\\nyou know, a particular document be put before the witness so if you look at the \\n\\ndocument, the list of persons, and tell him exactly the person you are talking about. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [11:33:48] Yes, yes.

Isn\\'t it a fact that they had ordered you not to meet -- not requested, but \\n\\nordered?   \\n\\nA.      [11:34:35] I was advised not to meet him. \\n\\nQ.      [11:34:37] Well, I didn\\'t ask whether you were advised.    You were ordered.   \\n\\nIt\\'s either a \"yes, I was ordered.\"    \"No, I was not ordered.    I was merely advised.\"   \\n\\nOr, \"I don\\'t recall.\"   \\n\\nA.      [11:34:52] I remember I was told not to meet him. \\n\\nQ.      [11:34:54] I beg your pardon? \\n\\nA.      [11:34:55] I was told not to him. \\n\\nQ.      [11:34:59] You were told not to meet him.    In other words, you were ordered \\n\\nnot to meet him?    I\\'m insisting on an answer.     \\n\\nYou said you were advised.    There\\'s a difference between being advised and being \\n\\nordered.    So which of the two?    And I suggest that you were ordered.   \\n\\nA.      [11:35:22] Okay, yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:35:23] \"Yes\" what?   \\n\\nA.      [11:35:26] As you say, I was ordered. \\n\\nQ.      [11:35:28] Okay.    And you stand by that?    I don\\'t want you to feel as if I\\'m \\n\\nputting words into your mouth, or that I\\'m intimidating you to the point where you \\n\\nmay need to seek protection from the Court.   \\n\\nA.

I had indicated that it wasn\\'t until you met \\n\\nwith the Prosecution, I think it was sometime in November 2014, when you were \\n\\nproofed for the Ruto and Sang case, that that\\'s when that meeting first came to light \\n\\nand they questioned you about it; is that right? \\n\\nA.      [11:36:42] Yes, they did.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:36:43] Okay.    And prior to that, prior to that, you had not mentioned to \\n\\nthe investigators that you had that meeting. \\n\\nA.      [11:36:59] I remember I had -- I had not mentioned. \\n\\nQ.      [11:37:03] Okay.    You say you remember.    Did you remember that during \\n\\nthe break, or -- I just want a solid answer that you did not tell them at all until they \\n\\nbrought it up.   \\n\\nA.      [11:37:16] What I know is that the investigator -- the investigators brought it up \\n\\nat a certain period that I had -- there is -- there is a recording which I had not \\n\\ndiscussed about. \\n\\nQ.      [11:37:30] Right.   \\n\\nA.      [11:37:32] What I don\\'t remember is the exact -- is the exact time.     \\n\\nQ.      [11:37:36] Okay. \\n\\nA.      [11:37:37] But I remember, surely, that I had not spoken about this with \\n\\nthe -- with the -- with the investigators until when they brought the matter \\n\\n(Overlapping speakers).   \\n\\nQ.      [11:37:48] Okay.    All right.    And we\\'re going to get to that date.

All of it.    Right?   \\n\\nA.      [11:38:45] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:38:46] All right.    And subsequent -- you didn\\'t tell them on that instance, \\n\\nduring that -- those days of interviewing, you didn\\'t tell them about that meeting, \\n\\nright?   \\n\\nA.      [11:38:59] You just mentioned that I -- that we discussed about the meeting. \\n\\nQ.      [11:39:03] You discussed the meeting when you had a proofing session.    This \\n\\nwould be in November 2014.    Here we are in March.    And what I\\'m suggesting is, \\n\\nyou had plenty of opportunities to mention that and you just -- it just sort of slipped \\n\\nyour mind.    It wasn\\'t on the radar.   \\n\\nA.      [11:39:26] I didn\\'t understand completely what you are -- what you are asking, \\n\\nbecause we just concluded that the investigators at a certain point brought up this \\n\\nissue of the first recording, and I explained about the recording. \\n\\nQ.      [11:39:43] Okay.    All right.    I don\\'t want to spend too much time on this, but \\n\\nbased on what we have, based on what we\\'ve read, the first time it\\'s brought up - and \\n\\nit\\'s brought up by the Prosecutor himself.    We have it on video during the proofing \\n\\nsession - is during that period.    It\\'s in November.    In other words, they say, \"Hey, \\n\\nwe have just uncovered that you had this meeting.\"    They had no clue, they were \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 43 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 44/117 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nclueless.     \\n\\nNow, how that slipped, you know, through their fingers -- we can blame them for not \\n\\nlooking at all the -- the tapes.    But the bottom line, as you said yesterday, the next \\n\\nday when you had the -- the -- the meeting that was supposed to take place, okay, you \\n\\nsaid three times you met with the investigators on that day, you spoke to them.    And \\n\\nthereafter, you never failed -- you never mentioned it.    And you indicated yesterday \\n\\nthat, because you -- you folks were in a hurry, there was too many things going on, \\n\\nand you couldn\\'t find the time to say, \"Oh, by the way, I met with this person last \\n\\nnight, even though you told me not to.\"   \\n\\nA.      [11:41:04] Yes, I have indicated -- or I have -- I have said that I did not inform \\n\\nthe investigators immediately about the meeting.    However, I handed over all \\n\\nthe recordings that I -- of my conversation with person number 2.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:41:24] Okay.    All right.    Now let\\'s go back -- all right.    We\\'ll -- we\\'ll skip \\n\\nthis.    We\\'ll -- we\\'ll get to that at some other point.    I just wanted to make sure \\n\\nthat -- to get your -- your understanding.    I wanted your understanding of what \\n\\n\"tell-all\" means.    Tell-all to me means you have to tell it all.    But this was something \\n\\nthat just slipped; is that right?   \\n\\nA.      [11:41:55] Tell-all means that I shall not -- that I tell them everything that I know.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:42:01] All right.   \\n\\nA.      [11:42:02] That is the meaning of tell-all, the way I understood it. \\n\\nQ.      [11:42:07] Now let me -- let me go on with the same -- what happened on that \\n\\nsame date, on -- we\\'re still on the document.    And now I\\'m going to skip through \\n\\nsome parts and we\\'re going to go to 0135-0051.    Same document, tab 30.    Just \\n\\na few -- you know, a couple of pages later.

[11:42:49] Which line are you reading?   \\n\\nQ.      [11:42:51] I\\'m reading at 3 -- 367.    366, actually.    It would be, like, \"I would like \\n\\nto interview you.\"    So they want a formal interview.    They\\'re informing you.    A \\n\\nformal interview where they\\'re going to record you, but, first, they\\'re also going to \\n\\nadvise you of your rights, right? \\n\\nA.      [11:43:20] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [11:43:20] And so you understood that, at that point, because of \\n\\nthe representations that they had made, that you were going to be treated as \\n\\na suspect -- that you were being treated as a suspect, right?   \\n\\nA.      [11:43:39] I didn\\'t understand that. \\n\\nQ.      [11:43:42] Well, had they not brought it to your attention 11 days earlier when \\n\\nthey said, \"We want to interview formally, and we want to tape-record it\"?    What \\n\\npart of that did you not understand?   \\n\\nA.      [11:43:55] At -- every time that I -- that I was interviewed by the -- by -- by \\n\\nthe investigators, it was -- at every time it was formal.    There is no time that has been \\n\\ninformal.    Including this time, it was formal.    And, therefore, to say this time was \\n\\nformal, I don\\'t know whether you are saying other times that the -- the investigators \\n\\ninterviewed me was informal. \\n\\nQ.      [11:44:26] Okay.    Let me -- let me clarify that.    Yesterday it was brought to \\n\\nyour attention that on previous occasions, when you were -- had these conversations \\n\\nwith them, you would sit down, there would be an exchange for days, hours, and \\n\\nthen the investigators would produce a summary report of what was all said, what \\n\\nwas shown to you, but there was no formal recording.    So no one can look at those \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 45 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 46/117 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\ndays and say, \"Okay, this was the question posed.    This was the answer given.\"   \\n\\nQuestion, answer, question, answer.    None of that.     \\n\\nAt the end, you were given a summary where you were to read it, make any \\n\\ncorrections, initial it, right?   \\n\\nA.      [11:45:17] No.    At most occasions, there were -- there were recordings. \\n\\nQ.      [11:45:23] Okay.    Are you suggesting that there are recordings that \\n\\nthe Prosecution has that they haven\\'t turned over to the Defence?    Because that\\'s \\n\\nwhat you\\'re suggesting right now.   \\n\\nA.      [11:45:34] All these matters that we -- we -- that I -- I gave in the previous -- in \\n\\nthe previous case, because I remember, most cases where I met with the investigators, \\n\\nthey -- they did -- this was not the first recording that they did on me.    There are \\n\\nmany other instances where I met them and the -- the same transcript -- I mean, \\n\\nthe paper that I signed were also -- were also recorded. \\n\\nQ.      [11:46:00] Okay.    So let me make sure that I got this crystal clear.    And you \\n\\nmight be confusing with the word \"recording\".    So let me -- let me clarify it, and then \\n\\nmaybe you can help me out here.     \\n\\nOn the previous occasions, that is, before the 15th, before the telephone call on \\n\\n14 March 2014, when you met with the OTP investigators, on those occasions, surely \\n\\nthey were maybe typing things out and then sharing you the summary and then you \\n\\nsigning it and initialling the date -- the pages.    That\\'s different from tape-recording \\n\\nwhen you have question, answer, question, answer, the entire event.     \\n\\nAnd let me just say one thing before you answer.    We don\\'t have any of such \\n\\nrecordings transcribed prior to this particular date.    So is it -- could you be mistaken?   \\n\\nA.      [11:47:14] My Honour, I remember most of the occasions, even in \\n\\nthe previous -- in the previous -- in the previous case, that when I was having my \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 46 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 47/117 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\ninterviews with the investigators, at other occasions, they were -- they were having it \\n\\nrecorded. \\n\\nQ.      [11:47:33] Okay.    Now, if we look at the same page, 0135-0051 -- I don\\'t want to \\n\\nbelabour the point, and the Prosecution is free to correct the record at any point.   \\n\\nLine 366, it says:    \"I would like to interview, but in a formal interview, a full and \\n\\nfrank interview.\"    Okay.     \\n\\nSo they\\'re mentioning formal interview, and they\\'ve already told you before that \\n\\nthey\\'re going to tape-record you.    Do you agree with that?   \\n\\nA.      [11:48:07] Yes, this is what they have said here --     \\n\\nQ.      [11:48:09] Okay.       \\n\\nA.      [11:48:10] -- in this conversation. \\n\\nQ.      [11:48:11] Okay.    And what did you think that they meant by, \"We\\'re going to \\n\\ntape-record you.    We want a formal interview.    We want to read you your rights.   \\n\\nYou have the right to have a lawyer.    Think about it, but we want the full -- full \\n\\ntruth\"?    What was your understanding of what was expected of you? \\n\\nA.      [11:48:29] My Honour, it was not my first interview.    And at ever other \\n\\ninterview, those are the wordings you are given by the investigators when \\n\\nthey -- when they are letting you to give -- to give -- to give an evidence.    And, to me, \\n\\nthey were -- these are the normal procedures of where investigators ask you to give \\n\\nthe -- to give the truth, to know that you are -- you are -- you are committed, that you \\n\\nwill sign the document, that at times you will be recorded.    All these -- all these \\n\\nthings are stipulated before you start giving your -- your evidence. \\n\\nQ.      [11:49:13] Okay.    But before they didn\\'t suggest that you had the right to \\n\\na lawyer to be present to -- to advise you.    This was the first time.    It was first \\n\\nmentioned on 14 March during a telephone conversation, because they told you, \"If \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 47 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 48/117 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nyou come, you know, you have the right to a lawyer.\"    And then they advised you \\n\\nagain before they began the questioning, the formal interview, that, \"By the way, you \\n\\nhave a right to a lawyer.\"    This was the first time, was it not? \\n\\nA.      [11:49:47] Yes, I think it was the first -- it was the first time, \\n\\nincluding -- including being searched, being standing up and being searched in \\n\\nthe pockets, if there\\'s a reason was happening -- I was carrying something.    That one \\n\\nwas the first time.    That\\'s why I said I had -- I saw some big differences, including \\n\\nbeing searched.    I had never -- they had never gone to that extent where they were \\n\\nsearching my pockets to search my -- to search -- and to undergo searching.    That is \\n\\nwhen I said I had -- I was -- I was -- I started to see some differences, and I was \\n\\nshocked and I was -- I was in fear.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:50:22] Right.    Okay.    They didn\\'t manhandle you when they were \\n\\nsearching you?    They weren\\'t rough on you?       \\n\\nA.      [11:50:22] I didn\\'t say they were rough.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:50:29] No, I\\'m asking.    I\\'m asking.    They were not rough, were they? \\n\\nA.      [11:50:32] They were not. \\n\\nQ.      [11:50:33] Okay.    They are gentle then? \\n\\nA.      [11:50:34] Yeah.    But it was the first time they were doing that. \\n\\nQ.      [11:50:36] Okay.    And that sort of took you back.    That sort of was unsettling \\n\\nfor you, that --   \\n\\nA.      [11:50:42] That\\'s what I saw, that things are different.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:50:44] Things are different.    Right.    Because you had already been warned \\n\\n11 days earlier that they thought that you were a double player.    You had been \\n\\nwarned earlier that you were a double player. \\n\\nA.      [11:51:03] In the conversation we\\'ve seen that, so ... \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 48 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 49/117 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nQ.

And we\\'re going to get to that.    All right.     \\n\\nAnd you want to paint the picture, and you want Madam President to understand \\n\\nthat you were -- that your -- your judgment or your -- your thinking capabilities were \\n\\nso clouded by fear that this spontaneous story came out.    That\\'s what you wanted us \\n\\nto get from you yesterday and today, right?   \\n\\nA.      [11:52:03] No.    I wanted -- for purpose of record, I explained even to the -- to \\n\\nthe investigators concerning this matter.    And I said, by the time we were meeting \\n\\nwith the investigators, I didn\\'t imagine even that I will finish the -- the meeting \\n\\nbecause of the situation that I was in with them.    The way they -- I said I -- I saw \\n\\nthem.    The way I saw their body language and how they were -- the interview on \\n\\nthat day, I thought I will be -- I will -- I will -- if I\\'m not arrested, I will go back home.   \\n\\nI never imagined that I was going to -- to be in agreement with them in anything.     \\n\\nQ.      [11:52:48] Okay. \\n\\nA.      [11:52:49] So, therefore, at first, at first I did not want to reveal this -- this person \\n\\nnumber 4 who actually introduced me to Mr Gicheru. \\n\\nQ.      [11:53:07] We\\'re going to get to that.

[11:53:27] It is not my testimony that they gave indication.    But I am saying \\n\\nthat --   \\n\\nQ.      [11:53:31] You felt that.

[11:53:39] And that feeling -- and that feeling motivated you to -- or inspired \\n\\nyou to give that spontaneous story about who introduced you to Mr Gicheru.   \\n\\nA.      [11:53:56] I said I was in fear.    And two, I thought I will be going back home.   \\n\\nAnd if I go back home and I have revealed the person who took me to your client, \\n\\nthen I will be in danger.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:54:14] Okay.    But did you not go there because you wanted them to help \\n\\nyou out, you wanted security?   \\n\\nA.      [11:54:23] But looking at them, I have explained several times that, at that \\n\\nmoment, I was not very sure that they will be giving me that security. \\n\\nQ.      [11:54:35] Okay.   \\n\\nA.      [11:54:36] And looking at -- at the way they appeared to me. \\n\\nQ.      [11:54:39] So when they told you -- when they were telling you, \"We\\'re more \\n\\nconcerned about the security issue, and we want to help you, but you have to tell \\n\\nthe truth\", you didn\\'t believe them.    You thought that they were lying.   \\n\\nA.      [11:54:58] Before I settled down and I stopped being in fear, I was having my \\n\\ndoubts on what they were telling me. \\n\\nQ.

If we look at -- starting with \\n\\nline 403:    \"This is an opportunity -- this is an opportunity for you -- for you to hear \\n\\nwhat we have and for you to effectively tell us.\"     \\n\\nSo they\\'re telling you, \"We\\'re going to tell you what we know about what you\\'ve been \\n\\nup to, but this is an opportunity for you to tell us as well\", right?

[11:57:32] They were very serious, I say, the way they looked. \\n\\nQ.      [11:57:36] Okay, okay.    \"We\\'re not talking about Scheveningen prison for your \\n\\nsecurity\".     \\n\\nYou know where Scheveningen prison is?    You know what they meant by that, \\n\\n\"We\\'re not talking about Scheveningen prison for your security\"? \\n\\nA.      [11:57:55] That they were not taking me to prison. \\n\\nQ.      [11:57:57] They weren\\'t taking -- by the way, it\\'s not so far from here.    It\\'s pretty \\n\\nnearby.    So they were saying, \"We\\'re not going put you in prison for your security.   \\n\\nWe\\'re not going arrest you.    We\\'re not going to imprison you.\"     \\n\\nSo -- and I take it you understood it at that point in time, right? \\n\\nA.      [11:58:16] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [11:58:17] Okay:    \"... we\\'re talking about relocating you out of the country, and \\n\\nthis is on instructions from the prosecutor.\" \\n\\nSo not only are they saying, \"We\\'re worried,\" but they\\'re -- they\\'re getting instructions \\n\\nfrom the Prosecutor. \\n\\nNow, when you heard that, were you still in fear for your -- you know, of these \\n\\npeople, that some -- that they were going to arrest you or do something harmful to \\n\\nyou?

[11:59:02] Okay.    Well, they keep talking though, because they seem to be not \\n\\nconvinced that they\\'ve gotten the point across to you.    Because if you go on to \\n\\nthe next page, 0135-0052, on line 410 -- okay.    Towards the end, it says:    \"As I say, \\n\\nwe need your full honesty.    We can\\'t have half-truths.\"     \\n\\nNow, I haven\\'t counted how many times they\\'ve said \"honest truth\" and what have \\n\\nyou, but doesn\\'t this seem thus far into the interview that it\\'s a recurring theme, that \\n\\nthey think that you have been less than honest? \\n\\nA.      [11:59:52] Yes, because I was -- I was -- I looked to be in fear. \\n\\nQ.      [11:59:57] Okay.    So --   \\n\\nA.      [11:59:58] And I -- and I know the investigators could also -- could also see \\n\\nmy -- my worries. \\n\\nQ.      [12:00:06] Okay.    So let me make sure I got this straight, Mr Witness.    Help me \\n\\nout here.    There\\'s this interview.    They\\'re looking at you.    They see fear in your \\n\\nexpression.    And to sort of calm you down from your fear, they say, \"We need your \\n\\nfull honesty, and we can\\'t have half-truths.\"    Is that what you\\'re trying to tell us, that \\n\\nthey can -- that\\'s what\\'s going on at that moment? \\n\\nA.      [12:00:37] As you\\'ve seen, they have spoken about -- about -- about this on \\n\\nseveral occasions in this interview. \\n\\nQ.      [12:00:43] I understand, but that\\'s --     \\n\\nA.      [12:00:45] And it\\'s my -- it\\'s -- it\\'s my -- I think -- I mean, it\\'s my thinking that \\n\\nthis is done because of -- they are repeating this to me in -- in order to make sure that I \\n\\ntell -- I tell the truth and not -- and not to trick them. \\n\\nQ.      [12:01:05] Right.    Because -- because, you know, if they wanted to calm you \\n\\ndown, they would say, \"Don\\'t worry.    Don\\'t worry.    Don\\'t worry.    Trust us.

Tell us \\n\\nthe truth.\"    Does that sound like they thought that you had been truthful in the past, \\n\\nyes or no?   \\n\\nA.      [12:01:35] Concerning this conversation, what I had done actually to \\n\\nthe investigators, what -- what I had done by -- by leaving and going -- and going \\n\\nback home was not good.    And that is why they wanted me, now in this \\n\\nconversation, to tell them the truth of what happened, how it happened, and \\n\\neverything that I knew concerning -- concerning my departure and now that I\\'m back. \\n\\nQ.      [12:02:01] Okay.    And that\\'s exactly what they wanted? \\n\\nA.      [12:02:04] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [12:02:05] So, later on, when they say, at line 425: \"I don\\'t think there\\'s any point \\n\\nin doing it,\" meaning the interview, \"if you\\'re not prepared to be honest with me.   \\n\\nOkay, it\\'s not about tricking you but I need you to be completely honest with me.\"   \\n\\nThat\\'s what they wanted? \\n\\nA.      [12:02:31] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:02:31] Because they thought that you had not been completely honest in \\n\\nthe past? \\n\\nA.      [12:02:40] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:02:41] Okay.

[12:02:43] And actually -- okay, you left. \\n\\nAnd then you say -- you say, \"I will be honest with you.\"    This is in line 427, okay?   \\n\\nTake it in.

[12:03:01] You did read well. \\n\\nQ.      [12:03:02] Okay.    \"I will be honest with you.\"     \\n\\nNow, we haven\\'t -- you haven\\'t even -- the interview hasn\\'t even started, but now \\n\\nyou\\'re giving assurances, you\\'re giving assurances to these investigators.    \"Now that \\n\\nI\\'ve come back, now that I know that I\\'m a suspect, now that I know what you want, I \\n\\nwill be honest with you.\"    Right?   \\n\\nA.      [12:03:22] Without the line that I know that I was a suspect.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:03:26] You didn\\'t know by that point you were a suspect?    Okay.    All right.   \\n\\nAll right.    We\\'ll move on. \\n\\nThey go on, 430:   \\n\\n\"Ok.    Do you want to put some thought in as to whether or not you want a lawyer \\n\\npresent?\" \\n\\nAnd you say:    \"No, I don\\'t think so.\"     \\n\\nNow the issue of the lawyer had come up previously.    You had 11 days to think \\n\\nabout a lawyer.    So you just said no, right?   \\n\\nA.      [12:04:02] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:04:03] Okay.    Now let\\'s look at line 433:     \\n\\n\"OK.    Again, if at any stage throughout the interview you want to discontinue, it is \\n\\nnot compulsory, it\\'s completely up to you.

You can stop the interview\"? \\n\\nA.      [12:05:12] You can see how long it has gone before we came to this.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:05:16] I\\'m asking you what you\\'re thinking at this point in time.    I\\'m not \\n\\nasking about what they\\'re doing.    It\\'s very clear what they\\'re doing, but I\\'m asking \\n\\nyou --   \\n\\nA.      [12:05:26] (Overlapping speakers)   \\n\\nQ.      [12:05:27] -- does this sound from you that they were threatening you to arrest \\n\\nyou, that they were putting you in fear when they\\'re saying, \"There\\'s the door.    You \\n\\ncan leave at any time.    You can have a lawyer.    You can talk to us.    You can leave\"?   \\n\\nDoes that sound like they were threatening you? \\n\\nA.      [12:05:45] Again, I did not say that they -- they did -- that they did harass me or \\n\\ndo anything of that nature.    I said I felt that I was in that situation. \\n\\nQ.      [12:05:59] And from their body language when they were saying these things?   \\n\\nA.      [12:06:02] So it is not my testimony that the investigators actually did put me in \\n\\nfear or intimidated me or make -- or made me feel -- or -- or, actually -- I mean, \\n\\ndid -- did -- did anything that was -- that was maybe by force.    No.    I\\'m saying, out \\n\\nof my own feelings --   \\n\\nQ.      [12:06:27] Okay.   \\n\\nA.      [12:06:27] -- because of the treatment that I underwent, internally I felt \\n\\nthat -- that there was -- there was some difference on how they were -- they were \\n\\nhandling me this time round.     \\n\\nBut you can see the investigators continuing even to give me more assurances, that if I \\n\\nneed to go home at any time, I can go.    At this point I started to -- to calm down, \\n\\nknowing that there is no issue.    I started to -- to -- and to see that there is -- there \\n\\nis -- there is no issue of arrest and things like that (Overlapping speakers). \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 56 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 57/117 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nQ.      [12:07:05] Okay.    All right.    I\\'m glad to hear that.     \\n\\nSo now you\\'re calming down because they further go on to say on line 442:    \"Sorry, \\n\\none other thing; if you do [not] want -- if you do want to go we are going to pay for \\n\\nyour transport back.    So it\\'s not like if you don\\'t cooperate with us we\\'re going to go; \\n\\n\\'OK ...\"   \\n\\nSo they\\'re saying, \"You know, we paid for you to come over here.    We\\'ll pay for you \\n\\nto go back.    You don\\'t want to talk to us, no harm, no foul, no problem.\"    Right?   \\n\\nThey\\'re willing to pay for you to go back.   \\n\\nA.      [12:07:49] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [12:07:49] Okay.    And I take it, that really calmed you down.   \\n\\nA.      [12:07:52] Yes, I started to calm down. \\n\\nQ.      [12:07:54] When you say you started, you know, how long did it take for you to \\n\\ncalm down?    I mean -- I don\\'t know.    I mean, you tell me.   \\n\\nA.      [12:08:05] I started to calm down.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:08:10] And then he says -- the other interviewer says:    \"We\\'re not going to \\n\\ntreat you bad.    If you want to go, you can go.\"    Right? \\n\\nA.      [12:08:20] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [12:08:20] So at this point you\\'re pretty calm, right?   \\n\\nA.      [12:08:27] At that point I started to calm down.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:08:29] Okay.    You started to calm down.    You knew you weren\\'t going to \\n\\nbe arrested at that point, right?   \\n\\nA.      [12:08:35] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:08:36] Okay.

Thank you, Madam President.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:40:48] Now you say it\\'s a private place, actually.    That\\'s on -- that\\'s in \\n\\npage 0135-0068, line 498.    So they\\'re asking you some details.    They say, \"You know, \\n\\nis it an office complex.\"    And you say, \"No, it is a private place actually; it\\'s a nice \\n\\nplace upstairs.    It\\'s a good\" --   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [12:41:19] Which tab are you talking about?   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [12:41:21] I\\'m on the same document.    It\\'s tab 31, your Honour.   \\n\\nAnd I\\'m still on the document -- the first page is 0135-0054.    And my apologies.     \\n\\nAt this point I\\'m on page 1 -- 0135-0068.    I was hoping to move it up a little bit faster, \\n\\nbut ...   \\n\\nQ.      [12:41:56] Do you have that, sir?    Do you have that section? \\n\\nA.      [12:41:59] I will get that now. \\n\\nQ.      [12:42:01] Why don\\'t you get it.    Let us know when you have it.   \\n\\nA.      [12:42:48] Tab 31. \\n\\nQ.      [12:42:49] You have it? \\n\\nA.      [12:42:50] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [12:42:51] Okay.    So if we look at --   \\n\\nA.      [12:42:55] What page?   \\n\\nQ.      [12:42:57] We\\'re looking at page 14.    That would be 0135-0068.    If you look at \\n\\nthe bottom, look at 14.   \\n\\nA.      [12:43:16] Page 14. \\n\\nQ.      [12:43:17] Okay.    So at the very top it mentions, you know, location number 19.   \\n\\nYou say, you know, location number 19 is a hotel.    Do you see that?

[12:43:40] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [12:43:40] Okay.    That was the detail that you provided, the location and where \\n\\nyou actually met, right?   \\n\\nA.      [12:43:52] The place, it is location of where I -- of the cover story that I used, that \\n\\nI -- that we met (Overlapping speakers).   \\n\\nQ.      [12:43:59] Right.    Right.    That\\'s a detail to your cover story.     \\n\\nAnd then later on, on line 496, they ask you if it\\'s an office complex.    And you say, \\n\\n\"No\" - this is on line 498 - \"it is a private place ... It\\'s a good place where people can \\n\\nsit.\"    You see that? \\n\\nA.      [12:44:21] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [12:44:21] So you pick the location.    It\\'s a private but open to the public.    And \\n\\nall of that is true, by the way, right, the location? \\n\\nA.      [12:44:30] That location exists. \\n\\nQ.      [12:44:32] Yeah.    And everything that you\\'re saying, that it is -- it\\'s not a -- it\\'s \\n\\nnot a -- an office complex.    It\\'s actually, you know, a private place, as you say, right?   \\n\\nA.      [12:44:44] It is a restaurant.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:44:46] Okay.    All right.    And then it goes on.    \"Did somebody take you \\n\\nthere and introduce you.\"    And you say, \"No, no, [no] ... No, we were seated with my \\n\\nfriend who was introducing me to him.    And we sat, [and] I went ... my friend called \\n\\nme and told me to go.    He said,\" location number 19, \"upstairs ...

[12:45:28] I have admitted that I used that cover story to cover my friend \\n\\n(Overlapping speakers). \\n\\nQ.      [12:45:33] No, I just want to -- I understand.    I understand.    But now I want to \\n\\ngo through this cover story.   \\n\\nA.      [12:45:37] (Overlapping speakers)   \\n\\nQ.      [12:45:37] Because the point I\\'m trying to make is that there\\'s a lot more to story \\n\\nthan, \"Oh, I just lied about this person.\"    Okay? \\n\\nThen there\\'s a reference to this individual and where he had been.    Right?    On \\n\\nthe same page.   \\n\\nA.      [12:45:59] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:46:00] Okay.    Now, if we go to the next page, because the story is a little \\n\\ndisjointed.    The Court will have an opportunity to read this and unscramble some of \\n\\nit, but the way the story came out during the interview was a little disjointed.    But at \\n\\nsome point, on the next page -- and this is 0135-0069, page number 15 for you, for \\n\\nyour assistance.    If we look at line 526 to 530.    Look at that for a second. \\n\\nHere you are saying that that person was in X country.    I don\\'t see it on the location \\n\\nchart.    That you had been trying to get a hold of him, and then you just met him.   \\n\\n\"And I met him now when I went to,\" location number -- number 5, \"when he was \\n\\nintroducing me to Gicheru.\"     \\n\\nDo you see that?    529-530, those are the lines.   \\n\\nA.      [12:47:27] Yes, I do. \\n\\nQ.      [12:47:27] And then, like a good interviewer who is listening to the answer and \\n\\nallowing the next question to be a follow-up, the interviewer goes:    \"Can I ask you, \\n\\nhow did [you] get in contact -- how did he get in contact with you?\"    Meaning \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 74 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 75/117 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nnumber 7.    And then you say:    \"We met in town.    Just coincidence.\"    Very \\n\\nspontaneous.    There\\'s no interruption here.    \"We met in town, just coincidence \\n\\nbecause I was in town doing shopping with my family and we just met on the streets.   \\n\\nIt was a surprise to get, and he knew that I was, I told him I had to withdraw too \\n\\nbecause -- I had to withdraw too because of the pressure I was getting.    The safe \\n\\nhouse and the demands [and] I wanted -- [and] I wanted [where we] -- were not met.\"   \\n\\n\"What I wanted were not met,\" basically, that\\'s what you are saying.   \\n\\n\"Probably he said,\" so now you\\'re imagining this conversation of this imaginary \\n\\nmeeting.    \"He said ... actually he said the same thing was happening to him when \\n\\nhe was in,\" that particular country.    \"And after chatting for some time now he said \\n\\nthat he knew Mr Gicheru and actually out of what we did together, I knew also about \\n\\nMr Gicheru and I knew what he was capable of doing.    And my fears actually were \\n\\nabout him when I was in town.    Now here is a person who could actually introduce \\n\\nme to him and make me safe maybe.\"       \\n\\nThose details are yours, right?   \\n\\nA.      [12:49:35] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:49:36] And this is an imaginary meeting that you\\'re having, that you\\'re \\n\\ntelling the investigators, right?   \\n\\nA.      [12:49:44] Yes, to cover my friend. \\n\\nQ.      [12:49:45] Right.    And in order to make the imaginary meeting more \\n\\nconvincible, more convincing, more believable, you provide them with this imaginary \\n\\nconversation that you are having with this imaginary person of this imaginary \\n\\nsituation, right?   \\n\\nA.      [12:50:06] I have told you I have --   \\n\\nQ.      [12:50:11] No.    I\\'m just asking --     \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 75 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 76/117 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nA.      [12:50:12] -- I covered my friend with -- with (Overlapping speakers).   \\n\\nQ.      [12:50:14] I understand you covered your friend.    But I\\'m suggesting, this is \\n\\nwhat you\\'re doing:    On the spot, you\\'re coming up with an imaginary scenario of \\n\\nwhat transpired, right?    And in the midst of it, you also have an imaginary \\n\\nconversation.    Do I have it right?   \\n\\nA.      [12:50:36] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:50:37] Okay.    We can agree on that? \\n\\nA.      [12:50:40] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [12:50:41] Okay.    And then it goes on.    And then there\\'s more detail about \\n\\nthe meeting and the conversation, and that pretty much ends the day of March 25, \\n\\n25 March 2014, right?     \\n\\nYou don\\'t correct that story on that particular day, or do you?   \\n\\nA.      [12:51:30] I don\\'t remember the exact date I did it, but out of the records that we \\n\\nhave seen now, the day have ended.    I have corrected it the next day (Overlapping \\n\\nspeakers).   \\n\\nQ.      [12:51:44] Okay.    All right.    Well, let me help you out here.    Let me help you \\n\\nout here.

[14:34:28] Do you recall that, sir?    When we left, on 25 March 2014 is when \\n\\nyou -- you ended the interview on that day giving the impression to the investigators \\n\\nthat you had told the truth and the truth was that it was person number 7 that had \\n\\nintroduced you to Mr Gicheru in location number 5.    Do you recall that? \\n\\nA.      [14:35:16] Yes.    By that date I had not revealed the person --   \\n\\nQ.      [14:35:20] Okay.   \\n\\nA.      [14:35:20] -- the person who took me to Mr Gicheru (Overlapping speakers)   \\n\\nQ.      [14:35:25] When you say you hadn\\'t revealed, you mean, not to put too fine \\n\\na point on it, you had lied? \\n\\nA.      [14:35:32] I had not revealed the true person who took me there. \\n\\nQ.      [14:35:36] Well, you had lied as to -- you know, you lied saying it was this \\n\\nperson as opposed to saying it was somebody else? \\n\\nA.      [14:35:43] I had covered my friend. \\n\\nQ.      [14:35:47] And in covering your friend, were you not lying, sir? \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [14:35:52] Mr Karnavas, the witness has answered. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [14:35:54] Okay.

[15:13:27] You did not inform anyone.    And it wasn\\'t because you didn\\'t have \\n\\nphones, right?   \\n\\nA.      [15:13:34] That was not the reason. \\n\\nQ.      [15:13:36] Okay.

[15:13:49] It wasn\\'t. \\n\\nQ.      [15:13:49] Okay.

[15:15:18] Well, was there another organisation that was involved that you were \\n\\ninvolved in? \\n\\nA.      [15:15:22] We have spoken about organisations I worked in.     \\n\\nQ.      Okay. \\n\\nA.      [15:15:25] We have spoken of -- and we are now talking about other \\n\\norganisations (Overlapping speakers)   \\n\\nQ.      [15:15:32] All right.    Let\\'s get back to the issue.    You had left a secure area, \\n\\nisn\\'t it a fact that by that point, by leaving, you had abandoned the programme that \\n\\nwas protecting you?   \\n\\nA.      [15:15:47] I had not left officially.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:15:51] Okay.    So unofficially you had left, but not officially? \\n\\nA.      [15:15:58] Yes, I decided to -- to -- to leave. \\n\\nQ.      [15:16:02] To leave.    And part of leaving you had also decided to withdraw? \\n\\nA.      [15:16:06] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:16:08] To withdraw as an OTP witness? \\n\\nA.      [15:16:11] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [15:16:12] That was a voluntary decision? \\n\\nA.      [15:16:18] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:16:19] Okay.    So when, according to this new version of your story, you \\n\\narrived in location number 5 from the secure area of location number 6, you had \\n\\nalready left the programme of being an ICC -- an OTP witness for the Ruto and Sang \\n\\ncase, correct?   \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 98 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 99/117 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nA.      [15:16:52] I confirm that I had not left officially.    I left the place number -- I left \\n\\nplace number 6 and we have seen that I have proceeded to place number 5 and I have \\n\\nalso seen the next destination.    We can just continue to explore what happened \\n\\nfurther.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:17:34] Okay.    Well, let me go back to the make-believe story.    When \\n\\nyou -- when you told in the previous story that you had met person \\n\\nnumber -- number 7, and that you had informed person number 7 that you had left \\n\\nthe programme, okay, in that -- was that one of the facts that was true or was that \\n\\na make-believe fact for that fake scenario that you were telling the investigators?   \\n\\nA.      [15:18:10] My Honour, I\\'ve explained myself concerning that matter, and \\n\\nthat -- and on those -- on those all situation.    And we have now come to \\n\\nthe statement which I confirm that they had -- this is the -- the -- the true part of \\n\\nmy -- part of my -- the -- the true testimony that I am giving --   \\n\\nQ.      Okay. \\n\\nA.      [15:18:39] -- to this Court. \\n\\nQ.      [15:18:42] Had you represented to person number 4 that you had withdrawn?   \\n\\nWhether it\\'s officially or unofficially, had you informed him when you arrived in \\n\\nlocation number -- number 5? \\n\\nA.      [15:19:00] Person number 4, what I had informed him is that I had intentions to \\n\\nwith -- to withdraw as -- as a witness of this Court.    He knew my intentions and I \\n\\nhad -- I had -- I had informed him of my intentions.    And now he took me to your \\n\\nclient in order to solidify my intentions and actually recant. \\n\\nQ.      [15:19:32] Okay.    So you had intended to withdraw? \\n\\nA.      [15:19:38] Yes.    And that is why I left place number -- I left place number 6 \\n\\nbecause of those intentions. \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 99 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 100/117 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nQ.      [15:19:46] And you went to place number 5? \\n\\nA.      [15:19:52] And I went to place number 5 and we have seen how the journey \\n\\ncontinued.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:20:01] Okay.    And it\\'s your -- it\\'s your testimony today that, having \\n\\ninformed, you know, person number 4 of your intentions when you in fact had left, \\n\\nphysically at least and were -- was back in country, as it were, it was then that he \\n\\ndecided to take you to see Mr Gicheru?   \\n\\nA.      [15:20:31] He made all the plans.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:20:34] He -- okay.   \\n\\nA.      [15:20:35] To see Mr Gicheru, according to the way they discussed with him.   \\n\\nAnd I was only given information that I was supposed to continue the journey to \\n\\nthe destination. \\n\\nQ.      [15:20:56] All right.    Now forgive me if I don\\'t readily accept your version.   \\n\\nBut other than person number 4, do you have anything that would back up your story, \\n\\nsomething that you can -- something tangible that you provided to the OTP, \\n\\nsomething that verifies that in fact on this particular day you were met as you were \\n\\ncoming off the bus or on the street of location number 5, that you met person number \\n\\n4, is there anything other than your word?   \\n\\nA.      [15:21:43] Yes, my Honour.    I would like to continue to inform this Court that \\n\\nall the documents that the Court has accepted as exhibits contains even the recordings \\n\\nthat we did to person number, person number 2, after conversations with him in \\n\\nthe -- the two meetings, which reveals exactly who is concerned with taking witnesses \\n\\nback home.    And therefore I would like to answer an affirmative that I have given \\n\\nsufficient evidence to this Court to show that the accused person is the one who was \\n\\nreceiving people back at home.   \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 100 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 101/117 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nQ.      [15:22:56] All right.    So you\\'re relying on that -- on the tape-recordings with \\n\\nperson number 2, your conversations with person number 2, if I understand you \\n\\ncorrectly?   \\n\\nA.      [15:23:15] Yes, my Honour, that -- that is one of my --   \\n\\nQ.      [15:23:19] Okay, all right.    And one of those recordings is of the unauthorised \\n\\nmeeting, right?   \\n\\nA.      [15:23:29] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:23:29] Now we\\'re going to get to that.    But let me put it to you this way.   \\n\\nWe don\\'t know what exactly you might have said to person number 2 and what you \\n\\nmight have agreed with person number 2 before you decided to turn on that \\n\\ntape-recording, do we?   \\n\\nA.      [15:23:58] I did record all conversations between me and person number 2. \\n\\nQ.      [15:24:03] So you say.   \\n\\nA.      [15:24:04] And that was my intention to record him.    That is why, even when I \\n\\nwent to this meeting which was unauthorised, I continued to record.    If I had other \\n\\nintentions, as you are putting to me, then I would not have recorded him in the first \\n\\nmeeting which was unauthorised. \\n\\nQ.      [15:24:29] All right.    Can you provide us with any -- we\\'re going to get to that \\n\\nand we\\'re going to go through it, but can you provide us anything concrete that \\n\\nwould show that there were no conversations between you and person number 2 \\n\\nwhen he arrived, when he stepped off the bus, to the time when you decided, in the \\n\\nrestaurant to begin tape-recording? \\n\\nA.      [15:25:00] That was the start of our conversation. \\n\\nQ.      [15:25:02] That\\'s what you say.    We have to accept your word on that, right?   \\n\\nA.      [15:25:08] Yes, I recorded every conversation. \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 101 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 102/117 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nQ.

[15:25:30] I have -- I have given -- I don\\'t know what other concrete -- other \\n\\nconcrete information you will want, apart from the true words, which comes not from \\n\\nme but from person number 2 himself explaining plain and clear who is responsible, \\n\\nwho has sent him, how much people are paid by -- by your client and where \\n\\nthe money is coming from.    All has been explained in the exhibits I have provided in \\n\\nthis Court. \\n\\nQ.      [15:26:01] Sir, isn\\'t it a fact that you had a lot of phones? \\n\\nA.      [15:26:09] Telephones?   \\n\\nQ.      [15:26:11] Yeah, mobile phones.   \\n\\nA.      [15:26:13] Yes, I had several. \\n\\nQ.      [15:26:13] Okay, you had several.    Now, you were under this -- under \\n\\nprotection in this secure environment.    Were you supposed to have all those phones?   \\n\\nA.      [15:26:25] When I made conversations with -- with my family, I had a phone to \\n\\ndo that.

[15:27:35] Now you also had a lot of SIM cards, right? \\n\\nA.      [15:27:38] All the phones had different (Overlapping speakers)   \\n\\nQ.      [15:27:41] I know the phones had SIM cards, but you also had SIM cards, you \\n\\nwere taking them, replacing them? \\n\\nA.      [15:27:47] I didn\\'t -- I didn\\'t have other SIM cards apart from the ones which \\n\\nwere on those phones. \\n\\nQ.      [15:27:54] And so when they were -- when they were examining the phones, \\n\\nthey would be able to see on each and every time that you used the phone who you \\n\\ncalled or who called you, right?   \\n\\nA.      [15:28:04] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:28:06] Now is it your testimony today, under oath, that all the phones that \\n\\nyou were using and all the SIM cards that you were using were authorised by either \\n\\nthe investigators of the OTP or VWU?   \\n\\nA.      [15:28:29] It is my testimony that apart from the phones that I used privately \\n\\nthat were not -- that were not for the purpose assigned by the officers of the Court, \\n\\nthey knew about -- about -- about that.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:28:45] (Redacted); \\n\\n(Redacted); \\n\\nA.      [15:29:00] I was not supposed to use my phones to do other -- that I could not \\n\\nmix the -- the conversations. \\n\\nQ.      [15:29:16] Well, one of the things they were concerned about was your safety, \\n\\nthat you shouldn\\'t be communicating with people that might, you know, know of \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 103 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 104/117 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nyour whereabouts, for your own security, right?    That was one of the reasons, no?   \\n\\nA.      [15:29:34] I believe so.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:29:36] And with the OTP investigators, they wanted to make sure -- they \\n\\nwanted to be able to monitor, to monitor who you were calling and who was calling \\n\\nyou; isn\\'t that a fact?   \\n\\nA.      [15:29:52] It was not made to me -- told to me that they were monitoring my \\n\\nconversations.    Because every conversation that came through the -- through \\n\\nthat -- that phone, I was -- I was -- I was submitting the information to them.    There \\n\\nis no -- there is no day I was told, \"Now, from today we are monitoring your \\n\\nconversations with whoever you will be calling.\"    What I was told is that when I get \\n\\ncommunication from a suspicious person, I should immediately inform \\n\\nthe -- the -- the investigators.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:30:34] Okay.    Well, maybe \"monitoring\" is the wrong word and I confused \\n\\nthings. \\n\\nNot monitoring in the sense that they\\'re listening in, but they wanted to have access \\n\\nto your phones and to your SIM cards so they would know, they would be able to \\n\\ncheck them.    And isn\\'t it a fact, sir, that they would do that periodically and without \\n\\nwarning?   \\n\\nA.      [15:30:58] I have told you -- I have told you -- or, rather, answered that there is \\n\\nno one day I was told that they are monitoring my calls, or I was made that it \\n\\nwas -- otherwise, it will be -- it will -- it would be a burden to carry phones with you, \\n\\nno -- you are -- you are -- it\\'s like every time you -- you receive a call, you don\\'t -- I \\n\\nmean it will be very difficult to use the phones like that.     \\n\\nBut I want to put it to you that the phones I was given had a certain use that I was \\n\\nasked to use.    For example, there are phones I could use, I could use for calling \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 104 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 105/117 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nthe -- the VWU within where I was, and those -- and those phones I used for -- for my \\n\\ndaily -- for my daily communication.    I could even sometimes lend \\n\\nthe phone -- the phones to my -- to a friend, remove the SIM card and put, because to \\n\\nme it was not -- it was not -- it was not an issue to do that.    If it -- if I had been told \\n\\nthat they will be monitoring periodically, as you have put it to me, then I would not \\n\\neven have lended a -- my phone to -- to a friend to use.    I would not have helped \\n\\na friend to use my phone. \\n\\nQ.      [15:32:41] Okay.    So let me make sure I understand your testimony.    Are you \\n\\nsaying - I don\\'t want to put any words in your mouth - that at no time the OTP \\n\\ninvestigators asked to -- asked for your phone in order to check to see who you had \\n\\ncalled and who had called you?    Did they ever do that?    Yes or no.    I don\\'t need \\n\\na big speech.   \\n\\nA.      [15:33:07] Excuse me, Counsel, you let me answer your question. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:33:10] Mr Karnavas, allow the witness to answer \\n\\nthe question.

Yes. \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [15:33:23] Now, my -- the telephone that I was using, it came a time \\n\\nwhen the telephones were -- were taken from me and they have been put \\n\\ninto -- into -- into a machine before me and I was told they are checking -- they were \\n\\ntrying to check some -- some communication that was of interest to them. \\n\\nThen, if that answers your question, in one occasion I have witnessed -- I did witness \\n\\nthe officers of this Court arrive to the -- to the -- to this place and I gave the phones \\n\\nfor -- they were -- they said they had interest to check on some information. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:34:18] \\n\\nQ.

[15:34:39] Is there one or more?    Which of the two?   \\n\\nA.      [15:34:44] I remember one occasion when I was asked for the phones, they were \\n\\nput into the machine. \\n\\nQ.      [15:34:49] And where -- was that when you were here in The Hague, is that -- or \\n\\nsomeplace else?    You don\\'t need to tell me that place.   \\n\\nA.      [15:34:55] Not, not, not here. \\n\\nQ.      [15:34:57] Okay.    So just one occasion you recall.   \\n\\nA.      [15:34:59] I remember -- I remember one occasion. \\n\\nQ.      [15:35:02] Now I take it they told you the reason why they wanted to check \\n\\nthe SIM card and check the phone, right?    They told you why they were doing that? \\n\\nA.      [15:35:14] They told me that they were looking for the vital information in \\n\\nthe phones. \\n\\nQ.      [15:35:18] All right.    Well might they have been telling you -- might they have \\n\\nbeen doing that because they also thought that you were having all sorts of private \\n\\ncommunications, whether it was on that phone or your private phones which you \\n\\nnever disclosed to them, that you were talking with others? \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:35:38] Are you asking -- Mr Karnavas, are you \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 106 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 107/117 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nasking the witness as to, you know, the possible reasons why they were -- they asked \\n\\nhim to check his phone or?   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:35:50] Yes, that\\'s one -- that\\'s one reason, yes. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:35:53] Would he know the reasons why \\n\\nthe investigators -- did they tell him? \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:35:57] He would have -- he would have been aware, they \\n\\nwould have told him why that he was looking -- or they were looking at his phone. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:36:03] Do you want to ask him (Overlapping \\n\\nspeakers)   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:36:06] I can -- I can go about it another way. \\n\\nQ.      [15:36:09] Were there times when the investigators were trying to verify, to \\n\\nverify communications you claim to have had, phone calls you have had, were there \\n\\ntimes when they -- to verify that information, they asked for your phone to check it? \\n\\nA.      [15:36:28] I have confirmed that there\\'s a time the investigators asked for my \\n\\nphone to check my vital information they wanted.    And it also came a time thereafter \\n\\nthat I was informed that they wanted to see the people who had communicated to me.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:36:55] And were you ever told that, for some reason or other, that \\n\\ninformation wasn\\'t on the phone or on the SIM card?   \\n\\nA.      [15:37:04] Yes.    I remember having been told that they have a few phone calls I \\n\\nhad reported that I had received that were -- that were not found on the telephone.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:37:18] Okay.    They were not found.    Were they not found because there \\n\\nwas a technical problem, not found because maybe the SIM card was taken out, you \\n\\nknow, when you take out the battery and take out the SIM card and you lend \\n\\nthe phone and somehow it got erased?    What was the reason? \\n\\nA.

And after \\n\\nthat, it automatically deletes. \\n\\nThe second reason I had for that, I believed to have -- to have -- to have caused that \\n\\none, is like I said before, at times I will leaned the phone to -- to -- to a friend to -- to \\n\\ncall and he could put his SIM card in the -- in the phone, and due to that, data also can \\n\\nbe lost. \\n\\nQ.      [15:38:30] And were you supposed to be doing that, lending your phone, \\n\\nputting SIM cards in and out?    Had they warned you against that for your own \\n\\nsafety purposes if nothing else? \\n\\nA.      [15:38:47] What I was warned about the phones is not to use the phones to call \\n\\nmy -- my country.    And that one I did not.    The person whom I was -- he was \\n\\nasking to be helped to call was not even -- was -- was not even calling this location \\n\\nthat I was -- that I was -- location number -- is it number 6 -- let me see.

[15:44:10] It was a landline number which is not a -- you understand when I say \\n\\nlandline --   \\n\\nQ.      [15:44:18] I think I get that.    I think I get it.    You know, you pick it up.    But \\n\\nwhat I\\'m asking, was that his office number? \\n\\nA.      [15:44:29] I don\\'t know.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:44:30] Okay.    Do law firms in -- in Kenya in general, if you know, I mean \\n\\nyou were a paralegal, do you know whether they have landline numbers?    Is \\n\\nthat -- or do they still use that?    I don\\'t know.   \\n\\nA.      [15:44:44] Yes, they do use also landline and they use also --   \\n\\nQ.      [15:44:50] All right.    And normally -- and in Kenya, I don\\'t know, maybe you \\n\\ncan help me out here, do lawyers in general have business cards in -- in Kenya?   \\n\\nA.      [15:45:02] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [15:45:02] Okay.

So all the information that you needed to know \\n\\nabout who Mr Gicheru is, where he can be located, physically, at least during \\n\\nworking hours, his landline, mobile, email, would have been readily available to you \\n\\nfrom a business card, right?   \\n\\nA.      [15:47:01] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [15:47:02] You\\'re shaking your head.    Yes, okay, good.    We need to get this on \\n\\nthe record so I don\\'t mean to push you on this.    Okay.     \\n\\nSo it wasn\\'t as if, if you needed to get hold of him, you didn\\'t know him, right? \\n\\nA.      [15:47:18] I didn\\'t know how.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:47:20] Okay.

I think maybe \\n\\nthe paragraph should be in private session, just in line of the decision of yesterday.   \\n\\nIt\\'s related to the testimony of the witness and money is mentioned, so for these \\n\\nreasons.    It may not be an offence under the jurisdiction of this Court, but it may be \\n\\nin another jurisdiction and it may expose the witness at risk.    So for this reason, I will \\n\\nkindly request the last paragraph to be redacted from the transcript. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:49:44] Actually, which paragraph, saying what?   \\n\\nI don\\'t see anything -- I don\\'t see anything that is actually wrong that ought not to \\n\\nhave been said in public. \\n\\nMS TERZIEVA:    [15:49:57] It\\'s page 135, line 3 to 7. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:50:13] Yes, he is just saying that he needed money. \\n\\nMS TERZIEVA:    [15:50:16] Yes. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:50:16] For some personal purpose and he sent \\n\\na message to a telephone. \\n\\nMS TERZIEVA:    [15:50:21] Okay. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:50:21] According to what he says, the accused\\'s \\n\\ntelephone.    But he received no response.    What is wrong with that really?   \\n\\nMS TERZIEVA:    [15:50:29] Well, it\\'s subject to interpretation.    I will -- if you -- I will \\n\\nwithdraw at this moment, but I will have to look at it again and (Overlapping \\n\\nspeakers)   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:50:46] No, no, but I think it is very clear.

So let me see if I can wrap this up in the next few minutes.   \\n\\nAt one point you said that you needed some money because one of your relatives was \\n\\nsick, right?   \\n\\nA.      [15:51:15] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:51:16] And they had to go to the hospital? \\n\\nA.      [15:51:19] He was in the hospital. \\n\\nQ.      [15:51:20] He was in the hospital.    And of course there came a time when he \\n\\nwould have to pay the hospital bills? \\n\\nA.      [15:51:25] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [15:51:26] And as I understand it, there was no money, you couldn\\'t help out, so \\n\\nyour relative actually left the hospital without paying the bill on -- at that time at least, \\n\\nright?   \\n\\nA.      [15:51:39] Yes.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:51:40] And you wanted to avoid that.    You wanted to avoid that, you \\n\\nwanted to help out your relative? \\n\\nA.      [15:51:46] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [15:51:47] Okay.    Now, here\\'s where I\\'m a little confused.    Maybe you can help \\n\\nme out here, okay?    Throughout your interviews with the OTP you have maintained \\n\\nover and over and over and over again, because they\\'ve been asking you over and \\n\\nover and over again, that you had no way of communicating with Mr Gicheru, that \\n\\nyou did not have a mobile number, that had to go through (Redacted).    Would that \\n\\nbe fair, that you\\'ve repeatedly said that, yes or no? \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 114 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 115/117 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nA.      [15:52:32] I remember you -- you having been told to let me answer your \\n\\nquestion.    Hope you remember that. \\n\\nI -- \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:52:41] Then go ahead and answer the question \\n\\nnow, Mr Witness. \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [15:52:45] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nI maintained that from the time I went to see -- we went to see Mr Gicheru in Nairobi, \\n\\nI -- the telephone number I had was a landline number.    I have also said it has \\n\\ncome -- it came to a time when I was in dire need of money and I was trying to \\n\\npush -- calling that number, there is no response.    Person number 4 actually gave me \\n\\na number to just make a text in order to request for the -- for the -- for the funds.   \\n\\nAnd I did that without any response. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [15:53:44] \\n\\nQ.      [15:53:44] Do you recall what year was that?    2013, \\'14, \\'15, do you recall \\n\\nthe year?   \\n\\nA.      [15:54:00] I don\\'t. \\n\\nQ.      [15:54:00] Okay.    Well, would it surprise you, sir, that, and I stand to be \\n\\ncorrected, I don\\'t want to mislead you, but from all the evidence that was provided to \\n\\nus from the Prosecution, all these documents, it\\'s not until the first proofing session \\n\\nfor today, that is back in July 13, 2021 in the presence of Mr Steynberg when you first \\n\\nsay -- when you first mention anything about having this SMS?    Does that come as \\n\\na surprise to you, that you\\'re mentioning for the very first time that all of a sudden \\n\\nnow you have his mobile number, now you have a means of sending an SMS, \\n\\nalthough you do say you never get a response?    Does that surprise you?   \\n\\nA.      [15:55:02] It is not a surprise because I am being honest. \\n\\n16.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 115 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-051-Red-ENG WT 16-02-2022 116/117 SZ T\\n\\nTrial Hearing                                                      (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nQ.      [15:55:06] Okay.    So when the other times when they were asking you whether \\n\\nyou have his mobile number, that must have been before you got the SMS or you had \\n\\nthe SMS and you weren\\'t telling the truth, or all of this that you\\'re telling us here \\n\\ntoday is another fairy tale, just the one you told the Prosecutors the day, you know, \\n\\nbefore you came supposedly clean back on 25 March 2014?   \\n\\nA.      [15:55:47] I can\\'t remember those days that I was -- I was giving my -- my \\n\\nstatement.    Now that it came to my mind when I was giving these statements in \\n\\nthe month of July, I could not hold it with me. \\n\\nQ.      [15:56:05] It was bothering you, it was a weight that you had to unload? \\n\\nA.      [15:56:09] No, because I know -- I actually know that I did send an SMS after \\n\\nI -- because I was in dire need of this money and I was not getting, so I did write an \\n\\nSMS to request for the -- for the -- for the fund.    However, I was not answered.    So I \\n\\njust became even more clearer when I -- when I -- when I said this.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:56:33] Okay.    Well, thank you very much for your testimony today.    We\\'re \\n\\ngoing to continue tomorrow, if you don\\'t mind. \\n\\nYour Honour, I think it\\'s about time to ... \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:56:46] It\\'s a nice time to end the session.     \\n\\nOkay, thank you very much, Mr Karnavas. \\n\\nMr Witness, I will thank you again for, you know, for your appearance today and for \\n\\nyour testimony for today and I will ask that you come on again tomorrow so that we \\n\\nfinish your cross-examination and, possibly if your counsel so wants, he may want to \\n\\nre-examine you.

Thank you. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:35:06] Thank you very much, Mr Karnavas.     \\n\\nAnd for the record, I take note that Mr Paul Gicheru is in court. \\n\\nGood morning, Mr Gicheru.     \\n\\nNow, for the members of the public, let me quickly introduce myself.    My name is \\n\\nMiatta Maria Samba and I am the Judge in this case. \\n\\nAs you are aware, we are here today for the opening of the trial of Mr Paul Gicheru.   \\n\\nI\\'ll open with a few preliminary remarks, and then the charges will be read.    We then \\n\\nintend to hear opening statements from or by the Prosecution. \\n\\nAs an introduction, I wish to provide some short background information to this case.   \\n\\nOn 31 March 2010, Pre-Trial Chamber II granted a request by the Prosecutor \\n\\nauthorising an investigation into the situation in the Republic of Kenya. \\n\\nThe proceedings before this Court is the third active case arising out of that situation.   \\n\\nThe Prosecution alleges that witnesses related to the proceedings of another case \\n\\nemanating from the Kenya situation, in the case the Prosecutor against William \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 2 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 3/97 SZ T\\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nSamoei Ruto and Joshua Arap Sang, have been influenced pursuant to Article 70 of \\n\\nthe Rome Statute. \\n\\nOn 15 July 2021, Pre-Trial Chamber A issued its decision on the confirmation of \\n\\ncharges in this case.    Therein, it confirmed several instances of alleged interference of \\n\\nwitnesses.    These are the charges brought before this Chamber. \\n\\nIn decision 185, the Chamber set a deadline of 21 January 2022 for the filing of any \\n\\nmotions requiring resolution prior to the commencement of trial.    The Chamber \\n\\nnotes Rule 134(2) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.    The Chamber will now \\n\\nask the parties whether - save any pending requests with the Chamber - they have \\n\\nany remaining objections or observations concerning the conduct of proceedings \\n\\nwhich may have arisen since the confirmation hearings.    Now be mindful that, in \\n\\naccordance -- be mindful, in accordance with Rule 134(2), no such objection or \\n\\nobservation may be raised during the trial proceedings without the leave of the Court. \\n\\nI now ask the Prosecution. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [9:38:14] may it please the Court, your Honours.    There are no \\n\\nobjections from the Prosecution.     \\n\\nThere is one pending request that the Prosecution noted in its trial brief, and that was \\n\\na request for the Chamber to consider legal recharacterisation of the charges to \\n\\nthe extent of the legal contributions of certain of the alleged intermediaries of the \\n\\ncommon plan, which the Pre-Trial Chamber found did not rise to the level of essential \\n\\ncontributions.     \\n\\nThis is a matter I will address in my opening address, so I\\'ll say nothing further on \\n\\nthat at this point.    But the matter is already on -- in our -- in our trial brief. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:38:56] Thank you very much. \\n\\nMr Karnavas, please. \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 3 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 4/97 SZ T\\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [9:39:00] No objections, your Honour.

This is the public redacted version \\n\\nof the charges, in which very limited information is redacted.

Thank you \\n\\nvery much. \\n\\nMR STEWART:    [9:49:08] Your Honour, the International Criminal Court was \\n\\nestablished to end impunity for those responsible for the most serious crimes of \\n\\nconcern to the international community.    It was established to seek justice for \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 7 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 8/97 SZ T\\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nthe victims of such crimes, it was established to seek the truth. \\n\\nBut in order to establish the truth, victims and witnesses must be able to testify freely \\n\\nand honestly.    And when their evidence is perverted through corruption or \\n\\nintimidation, the truth is obscured and justice is denied. \\n\\nThe Prosecution brings this case against Paul Gicheru to protect the integrity of \\n\\nthe Court\\'s proceedings from offences against the administration of justice, to punish \\n\\nthose responsible and deter future offenders.    We seek to preserve and strengthen \\n\\npublic confidence in the Court and the expectations of those who look to the Court to \\n\\nestablish the truth and deliver justice.    Those who would seek to undermine \\n\\nthe Court\\'s ability to provide redress for the victims of mass atrocities cannot be \\n\\nallowed to prevail.    They must be held accountable.     \\n\\nYour Honour, the investigation and Prosecution of William Samoei Ruto and \\n\\nJoshua Arap Sang was beset from the outset with witness interference and \\n\\nintimidation problems, which continued up to and throughout the trial.    In \\n\\ndismissing the charges against those two accused, the judges, in both the majority and \\n\\nminority opinions of the Trial Chamber, condemned the levels of witness interference, \\n\\nwhich had made it impossible for the Chamber to ascertain the truth.     \\n\\nThe most egregious and damaging instance of such witness interference - with \\n\\nthe accused Paul Gicheru allegedly at its centre - commenced in early 2013 and \\n\\ncontinued throughout the trial.    This interference caused the Office of the Prosecutor \\n\\nto start an investigation, in parallel with the Ruto and Sang trial, into numerous \\n\\nreports of witness tampering.    That investigation allowed the Prosecution to uncover \\n\\nand document the commission of the offences that form the basis of the case that is \\n\\nnow before this Chamber. \\n\\nThe evidence gathered in the investigation will show that the accused managed and \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 8 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 9/97 SZ T\\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\ncoordinated a scheme to identify, locate, and corruptly influence actual and potential \\n\\nProsecution witnesses.    This was done through a combination of bribery and \\n\\nintimidation.    The actions of the accused and his associates led directly to \\n\\nthe withdrawal and recanting of no less than four vital Prosecution witnesses in \\n\\nthe Ruto and Sang case.    The efforts of the accused and his associates to influence \\n\\ncorruptly a further two witnesses were only thwarted because the witnesses they \\n\\ntargeted reported this to the Prosecution.     \\n\\nWhile the Prosecution does not allege that the accused was himself directly involved \\n\\nin the disappearance and presumed death of another Prosecution witness, or in \\n\\nthe murder of a prospective Defence witness and a former Prosecution intermediary, \\n\\nMeshack Yebei, both of these individuals, as the narrative of the case will show, were \\n\\ncaught up in the witness tampering scheme. \\n\\nThe accused and his associates may not have been the only persons responsible for \\n\\nwitness intimidation and tampering in the Ruto and Sang case.    However, \\n\\nthe evidence will establish beyond a reasonable doubt that they were responsible for \\n\\nthe offences charged in this case.     \\n\\nThis trial, therefore, represents an important step towards holding those responsible \\n\\nfor witness interference in the Kenya cases accountable for their actions and achieving \\n\\nsome measure of retribution on behalf of the victims who were denied justice. \\n\\nThe Prosecution notes that two further suspects, for whom arrest warrants have been \\n\\nissued for the same offences, remain at large and we call upon the Kenyan authorities \\n\\nto take all necessary steps to surrender these two suspects to the Court without \\n\\nfurther delay. \\n\\nYour Honour, I yield the floor now to senior trial lawyer Anton Steynberg and \\n\\nthe Prosecution team, who will outline in detail the case that the Prosecution will \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 9 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 10/97 SZ T\\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\npresent to establish the guilt of Paul Gicheru.   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [9:54:33] Good morning again, Madam President.

Rather, we will focus on the evidence that \\n\\nwill be presented and how this will demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that \\n\\nthe accused committed the charged offences and his criminal responsibility. \\n\\nAs confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber, the accused is charged with eight counts of \\n\\ncorruptly influencing Prosecution witnesses in the Ruto and Sang case, in \\n\\ncontravention of Article 70(1)(c) of the Rome Statute.     \\n\\nThis was done through a wide-ranging and concerted scheme of witness interference \\n\\nover the course of almost two and a half years. \\n\\nThe accused bears criminal responsibility under several possible modes of liability:   \\n\\nDirect, indirect, and accessory.     \\n\\nIn this opening address, the Prosecution will focus on the accused\\'s criminal liability \\n\\nby way of his direct and personal perpetration of acts of corrupt influence, as well as \\n\\nhis essential contributions to a common plan to do so. \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 10 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 11/97 SZ T\\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nThe common plan, confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber, encompassed \\n\\nthe identification, location and contacting of Prosecution witnesses and potential \\n\\nProsecution witnesses in the Ruto and Sang case, offering and paying them financial \\n\\nbenefits and threatening or intimidating them, all to induce them to withdraw as \\n\\nProsecution witnesses in that case, to refuse to cooperate or to cease cooperation with \\n\\nthe ICC, and to recant the evidence which they had provided to the Prosecution. \\n\\nThe common plan group comprised of a number of persons who undertook specific \\n\\nroles.    Some, including the accused, fulfilled the role of managers, who organised \\n\\nthe activities of other common plan members, arranged financing and negotiated \\n\\nbribe amounts with witnesses who were corruptly influenced.    Intermediaries were \\n\\nresponsible for locating and contacting witnesses and persuading them to meet with \\n\\nthe common plan managers to be bribed or intimidated. \\n\\nAnd still others - while not confirmed as members of the common plan - were \\n\\nassociated with it and made contributions to the commission of at least one offence \\n\\ncharged. \\n\\nAnd as I noted earlier, your Honour, the Prosecution notes in this regard and it has \\n\\nprovided submissions in its Trial Brief that the Pre-Trial Chamber, with respect, \\n\\nmischaracterised the contributions of certain of these associates and invited \\n\\nthe Trial Chamber to exercise its power to legally recharacterise these contributions as \\n\\nessential and to give the Defence notice of this possibility, pursuant to \\n\\nRegulation 55(2).   \\n\\nIn fairness to the Defence, the earlier this notice is given the better it would be for \\n\\nthem.   \\n\\nI will now briefly touch upon some of the main types of evidence that the Prosecution \\n\\nwill present in support of these eight counts.

Prior to these \\n\\ndeposits, the balance on this account was 297 shillings. \\n\\nPhone records will confirm these two deposits, as they reflect text messages from \\n\\nthe bank confirming these two deposits.   \\n\\nPhone records will also corroborate his contact with the accused, whose phone \\n\\nnumber was recorded in the witness\\'s contact list.     \\n\\nThe number reflected in the contact list corresponds with numbers that may be found \\n\\non the accused\\'s business cards and letterheads.     \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 13 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 14/97 SZ T\\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nWe will also produce a letter of withdrawal sent to the Prosecution by the lawyer to \\n\\nwhom he, the witness, was referred by the accused.     \\n\\nWe will prove recorded calls between the witness and the accused and also with \\n\\ncommon plan intermediary Yebei, the contents of which, we say, are inconsistent with \\n\\ninnocence.     \\n\\nAnd we will present the testimony of other witnesses, including P-516, P-613 and \\n\\nP-341, who will provide corroboration for the version of P-397.     \\n\\nP-516 will confirm that P-397 took him to meet the accused, who paid him.     \\n\\nP-613 will confirm receiving reports from another common play intermediary P-579 \\n\\nthat he, that is 397, was paid 500,000 Kenyan shillings by the accused.   \\n\\nAnd P-341 will provide the following evidence:   \\n\\n\"I also saw P-397 and P-516 at Gicheru\\'s office many times.

And I quote from line 593.    I beg your pardon, 594:   \\n\\n\"So, I heard Gicheru telling Meshack,\" - Meshack Yebei - \"\\'You\\'ll go and look for him.\\'   \\n\\nMeshack told him, \\'No.    I think he sometimes speaks to 397.

So, I \\n\\nbrought him in.    I told Gicheru to talk to this person.

She describes this as follows:     \\n\\n\"P-495 told me that Gicheru has been given all the authority.   \\n\\nP-495 told me when you are given money they have offered protection because they \\n\\ndon\\'t want you going back to the ICC.

Gicheru had previously told me the ICC can \\n\\ninspect the records at the bank if I deposited the money.\" \\n\\nNotwithstanding this warning, the witness did in fact deposit a significant portion of \\n\\nthe money he received from the accused in his bank account, which the ICC did \\n\\nindeed trace. \\n\\nOver a period of approximately a year, the witness deposited a sum of 1 million \\n\\nKenyan shillings into his bank account, as is reflected by the bank records that he \\n\\nprovided to the Court.   \\n\\nThere are also phone records.     \\n\\nThe witness will testify that:    \"Gicheru told me not to call the office and Gicheru \\n\\nentered his number in my phone.\"    And he gives the number, which I have redacted: \\n\\n\"which Gicheru saved on my phone as \\'Paulo\\'.\"    And indeed there is a contact Paulo \\n\\non the accused\\'s contact list under the same number that appears on 397\\'s phone \\n\\nrecords, as well as the business cards and letterheads of the accused. \\n\\nFurthermore, the evidence of P-274 will corroborate the corruption of P-341 by \\n\\nthe accused.

He said that they needed to reach everyone \\n\\ninvolved in this case, indirect or direct.    He said the big man, mkubwa, wanted no \\n\\nstone left unturned.

He also told me \\n\\nthat I would now be safe. \\n\\nHe also wanted me to give him details of other people I knew who are witnesses or \\n\\nvictims in the ICC case.\" \\n\\nAs regards corroboration, P-341 confirms that the accused was looking to recruit \\n\\nP-274:   \\n\\n\"During the meeting they\" - including the accused - \"told me to locate my friend P-274 \\n\\nto meet with Gicheru and sign an affidavit to withdraw from the ICC.\" \\n\\nYour Honours, besides the direct evidence on the eight counts, the Prosecution will \\n\\nalso call another witness, P-743, who will confirm that he too was paid by the accused \\n\\nto withdraw from the Ruto and Sang case, following the same modus operandi. \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 24 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 25/97 SZ T\\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nAnd apart from the individual proof of the commission of each counts, there is \\n\\nthe cumulative effect of the evidence, your Honours, which demonstrates a consistent \\n\\npattern of behaviour by the accused and his associates for a consistent purpose: to \\n\\nlocate, contact, and bribe or intimidate Prosecution witnesses to withdraw and recant \\n\\ntheir evidence. \\n\\nThe Prosecution will also tender a number of other documents, including phone \\n\\nrecords and transcripts of an interview with the accused, in which he made certain \\n\\nadmissions.

In so doing, the accused \\n\\ninterfered with the course of justice and committed the offences charged.     \\n\\nIn the next 10 minutes I will set out the key evidence the Prosecution says establishes \\n\\nthe individual criminal responsibility of the accused as a direct co-perpetrator.   \\n\\nHowever, as submitted by the Prosecution in the Document Containing the Charges \\n\\nand subsequently in the Prosecution Trial Brief, and as briefly mentioned by \\n\\nMr Steynberg before, the accused\\'s conduct can also be legally characterised under \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 25 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 26/97 SZ T\\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\ndifferent modes of liability. \\n\\nBut let me turn now to the accused\\'s culpability as a direct co-perpetrator.     \\n\\nYour Honour, you will hear and read evidence in this trial about the common plan \\n\\nthe accused devised with the assistance and participation of others.    The same \\n\\nwitnesses who were contacted and targeted by the accused and these other \\n\\nindividuals will testify when and how the plan was set in motion and how it operated \\n\\nto achieve the set objectives.    These witnesses will identify the individuals who \\n\\ncorrupted them and describe their respective roles and responsibilities in \\n\\nthe execution of the plan, which as Mr Steynberg mentioned before, included \\n\\nmanagers, intermediaries, and other types of associates. \\n\\nAs I said, I will focus today on the accused, on how he participated in this plan, what \\n\\nrole he had, and what contributions he made to its implementation.     \\n\\nTestimonial evidence will show that he was essential in directing and coordinating \\n\\nthe activities of the members of the plan.    You will hear and read first from \\n\\nthe witnesses targeted.     \\n\\nTheir evidence previous, on its own, the accused\\'s criminal responsibility in this case.   \\n\\nHowever, witness evidence will not be the only evidence you will hear, your Honour.   \\n\\nYou will see bank statements showing large deposits of money on witnesses\\' bank \\n\\naccounts right after having been bribed.    You will also see phone data records, as \\n\\nwell as audio recorded conversations between witnesses and members of \\n\\nthe common plan, including the accused, showing witnesses were been approached \\n\\nand unduly influenced. \\n\\nIn all, the evidence will show that Mr Gicheru played the key role of a manager.   \\n\\nFrom his office in Eldoret, the accused\\'s leveraged his influence as a prominent \\n\\nmember of the community and of the legal profession.

It will show that \\n\\nthe accused meant to engage in his conduct.     \\n\\nAs an experienced member of the Kenya bar, there can be no doubt that the accused \\n\\nwas aware that the common plan had a criminal component, or that \\n\\nthe implementation of this plan was virtually certain to result in the commission of \\n\\nthe offences.     \\n\\nIn this respect a witness will say that Mr Gicheru told him he knew ICC people were \\n\\ninvestigating him, and he knew he could go to prison.     \\n\\nSimilarly, other testimonial evidence will show that a witness was told not to deposit \\n\\nthe money he received from the accused in the bank because, and I quote: \"These ICC \\n\\npeople have devices to follow up with banks and they will see [the money].\"    End of \\n\\nquote. \\n\\nFurther evidence will show that the accused was also aware that his role in \\n\\nimplementation of the plan was essential, and that he knew that due to the essential \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 28 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 29/97 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\nnature of his contribution he could have frustrated the implementation of this plan.   \\n\\nHe could have impeded it, he could have reported it and, above all, he could have \\n\\nsimply declined to engage in it. \\n\\nIn sum, your Honour, the evidence the Prosecution will present in this trial will show \\n\\nthat the accused, together with others, worked in unison to identify and locate \\n\\nwitnesses, to contact them to offer and provide financial and other benefits, all in \\n\\norder to induce them to withdraw as witnesses, to recant their evidence or cease and \\n\\nrefuse to cooperate with the Court in the Ruto and Sang case. \\n\\nYour Honour, with this conduct, the accused engaged in the commission of \\n\\nthe offences charged and he did so with the required intent and knowledge. \\n\\nYour Honour, the evidence in this case will show beyond any reasonable doubt that \\n\\nMr Gicheru is criminally responsible for all of the Article 70 offences against \\n\\nthe administration of justice for which he was committed to trial. \\n\\nThank you, your Honour.

For the record, this is paragraph 24 of \\n\\ndecision 223.    The reason for this is that the Chamber considered that these items fall \\n\\ninto the category of materials which the Defence wanted to challenge under \\n\\nArticle 69(7) of the Rome Statute.     \\n\\nSince the Chamber ruled on the Defence\\'s Article 69(7) request in a decision issued \\n\\nyesterday, that is filing 284, the Chamber will now render its decision on the three \\n\\nitems in question. \\n\\nIn yesterday\\'s decision, the Chamber rejected the Defence\\'s request to declare certain \\n\\naudio recordings made by witnesses inadmissible.    In light of this fact, the Chamber \\n\\nnow also grants the request by the Prosecution in respect of audio file \\n\\nKEN-OTP-0109-0017 and the two associated transcripts, KEN-OTP-0109-0013 and \\n\\nKEN-OTP-019 -- 0109 - excuse me - 0015.    This covers, of course, just the general \\n\\nauthorisation to introduce the items via Rule 68(3). \\n\\nThe remaining conditions, such as the witness\\'s approval to the introduction, will \\n\\nhave to be fulfilled when the witness starts testifying. \\n\\nThis concludes the oral decision. \\n\\nAnd before commencing, the Chamber notes briefly that protective measures are \\n\\nconfirmed to this witness by virtue of decision 276 and that the VWU recommends no \\n\\nfurther protective measures. \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 31 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n

This applies as long as you do not commit any offence or misconduct when \\n\\ntestifying, such as by intentionally giving testimony which is false or lying to \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 37 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 38/97 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nthe Chamber.     \\n\\nIf any question is asked that could lead to your self-incrimination, we will hear your \\n\\nanswer in private session and keep this answer confidential. \\n\\nMr Witness, do you understand? \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [11:52:59] Yes, your Honour.    I understand. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [11:53:02] And lastly, I also have a few practical \\n\\nmatters you should have in mind when giving your testimony.    Everything we say \\n\\nhere in the courtroom is written down and interpreted.    It is, therefore, important to \\n\\nspeak clearly and at a slow pace.    Please speak into the microphones, and only start \\n\\nspeaking when the person asking you the question has finished.    To allow for \\n\\nthe interpretation, everyone has to wait a few seconds before starting to speak. \\n\\nIf you have any questions yourself, raise your hand so we can know that you wish to \\n\\nsay something. \\n\\nHave you understood all of that, Mr Witness? \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [11:53:58] Yes, your Honour. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [11:54:00] Thank you very much. \\n\\nWe will then start your testimony. \\n\\nMr Steynberg, your witness. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [11:54:11] I\\'m very grateful, your Honour.   \\n\\nQUESTIONED BY MR STEYNBERG:   \\n\\nQ.

All right. \\n\\nIf I can ask you to please, Mr Witness, bearing in mind we\\'re in open session, to turn \\n\\nto the last page of the protected information list.    It\\'s page 5, and it\\'s entitled \\n\\n\"CV/Personal Information\". \\n\\nPlease let me know when you have it.   \\n\\nA.      [11:55:25] I have it.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:55:27] And can you take a moment to have a look through the contents of \\n\\nthis page.    And when you are done, if you can confirm that this information was \\n\\ndiscussed with you in the witness preparation session over the last week, and \\n\\nwhether you confirm this information under oath today.   \\n\\nA.      [11:56:14] I do confirm.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:56:16] Thank you very much, Mr Witness. \\n\\nBy way of introduction, Mr Witness, is it correct that you were a Prosecution witness \\n\\nin the Ruto and Sang case?   \\n\\nA.      [11:56:27] Yes, my Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [11:56:29] And is it also correct that you provided witness statements in that \\n\\ncase to Prosecution investigators concerning post-election violence and, in particular, \\n\\nvarious planning meetings allegedly attended by Mr William Samoei Ruto?   \\n\\nA.      [11:56:49] Yes, my Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:56:52] And besides the statements you made in the main case about \\n\\nthe post-election violence, did you provide any other witness statements to \\n\\nthe Prosecution?   \\n\\nA.      [11:57:09] Repeat your question. \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 39 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 40/97 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nQ.      [11:57:10] Besides the witness statements you made that concerned the subject of \\n\\nthe post-election violence, did you make any other witness statements concerning \\n\\nother subjects?   \\n\\nA.      [11:57:23] Yes, my Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:57:25] And -- sorry.    Briefly, for the record, what -- what did those concern?   \\n\\nWhat was the subject matter of the other statements?   \\n\\nA.      [11:57:35] It was about witness bribery. \\n\\nQ.      [11:57:40] Witness bribery.    Thank you. \\n\\nAnd finally, do you confirm that you testified before Trial Chamber V in the Ruto and \\n\\nSang case?   \\n\\nA.      [11:57:53] Yes, my Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:57:58] Mr Witness, I can inform you that the Chamber has ruled that in order \\n\\nto make these proceedings more efficient, the Prosecution may submit into evidence \\n\\nyour previously recorded evidence, including the witness statements I\\'ve just referred \\n\\nto.    Do you understand?   \\n\\nA.      [11:58:20] Yes, my Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:58:22] However, this is contingent, this is dependent on the fact that you do \\n\\nnot object to the handing in of these statements.    Do you understand? \\n\\nA.      [11:58:29] Yes, I understand.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:58:31] This means that I can only ask -- that I can ask you -- or I can focus my \\n\\nquestions on only those issues that I consider most relevant to lead your evidence in \\n\\nopen court.    And I do not have to ask you questions on all the details of all your \\n\\nstatements.    Do you understand?   \\n\\nA.      [11:58:51] Yes, my Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:58:52] However, the Defence lawyer and possibly the Judge may question \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 40 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 41/97 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nyou on any of the information you provided and any other relevant subjects, even if I \\n\\ndon\\'t ask you.

I\\'d like to ask you to confirm whether you\\'ve had an \\n\\nopportunity to review all of your prior recorded statements over the course of \\n\\nthe past week.   \\n\\nA.      [11:59:24] I confirm.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:59:25] And besides these statements that you provided the Prosecution, did \\n\\nyou also have an opportunity to review the evidence you provided before \\n\\nTrial Chamber V in the Ruto and Sang case?   \\n\\nA.      [11:59:38] Yes, my Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [11:59:41] All right.    I\\'d like you to have a look at the list of documents in front \\n\\nof you.    Do you recognise this document?   \\n\\nA.      [11:59:58] Yes, I do. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [12:00:01] Your Honour, for the record, this should be in the front \\n\\nof the first binder that the court officer has placed on your desk.    Binder number 1.   \\n\\nAnd it should be immediately recognisable by the yellow highlights on the left-hand \\n\\ncolumn. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [12:00:23] (Microphone not activated)   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [12:00:25] Thank you.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:00:27] What is this document, Mr Witness?   \\n\\nA.      [12:00:36] I have two documents before my desk.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:00:39] Sorry.    I\\'m referring to the -- to the last mentioned document, \\n\\nthe -- the list of documents with the yellow highlights in the left-hand column.   \\n\\nA.

[12:01:02] Okay.    And do you see in the most right-hand column, there are \\n\\na series of ticks in the box on the right-hand side?    Can you see that? \\n\\nA.      [12:01:14] Yes, I do. \\n\\nQ.      [12:01:15] And can you tell the Court who put the ticks there.   \\n\\nA.      [12:01:19] I did.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:01:21] And what do these ticks signify? \\n\\nA.      [12:01:32] The ticks signify that I have read the documents.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:01:42] Can I ask you to turn to page 6 of the document.    You will see \\n\\nthe highlights in the left-hand column turn to green, and particularly, item 102.   \\n\\nAnd let me know when you have that, please.   \\n\\nA.      [12:02:09] I have it. \\n\\nQ.      [12:02:10] In the second last column, there is a signature or some initials there.   \\n\\nCan you identify that, please.   \\n\\nA.      [12:02:18] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [12:02:20] Whose is -- sorry.    Whose signature is that? \\n\\nA.      [12:02:23] It\\'s my signature. \\n\\nQ.      [12:02:24] All right. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [12:02:28] Your Honour, I can confirm that the witness signed and \\n\\nticked this document during the course of the witness preparation session and \\n\\nprovided it to us.    He was actually asked to sign the document at the end, but \\n\\nbecause the session was conducted remotely, we only got it afterwards.    And I see he \\n\\nhasn\\'t signed it at the end, but his signature does appear at item 102.    I hope that will \\n\\nsuffice. \\n\\nQ.      [12:02:56] Keeping on the page that I just directed your attention to, there are \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 42 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 43/97 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nalso some ticks in the second from right-hand column, and in particular items 96, 100, \\n\\n104 and 106.    Do you see those ticks? \\n\\nA.      [12:03:17] Yes, I do. \\n\\nQ.      [12:03:18] And these are in the column that is entitled \"ERN of AV recording (if \\n\\napplicable)\".    What do those ticks signify?   \\n\\nA.      [12:03:31] These ticks signify that I did listen to the recordings.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:03:40] And were you able to identify the recordings that you listened to? \\n\\nA.      [12:03:47] I did, my Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:03:48] And what were those recordings of? \\n\\nA.      [12:03:52] The recordings that are recorded during my conversation --   \\n\\nQ.      [12:04:00] Remembering, we\\'re in open session.    So if you\\'re going to mention a \\n\\nname, please do so with reference to the number on the protected information list.   \\n\\nA.      [12:04:12] Yes, my Honour.    It\\'s my recordings with the people that I recorded \\n\\nduring my conversation with them.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:04:19] And do you see the names of any of these people on the list, starting \\n\\nat page 3, under the title \"Persons\", and going over to page 4?   \\n\\nA.      [12:04:43] I did record my conversation with person number 2, person number 4, \\n\\nperson number 16.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:05:15] Thank you.    Are you finished?   \\n\\nA.      [12:05:37] Yes, my Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:05:40] All right.    And were you also asked to compare these recordings \\n\\nwith the transcripts in the corresponding columns of the items I\\'ve mentioned, and all \\n\\nthe other items where you\\'ve ticked the audio visual recordings? \\n\\nA.

[12:06:08] That the recordings were well translated in words.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:06:16] All right.    Be careful with the -- with the word \"translation\".    I\\'m \\n\\nreferring now to the transcript in -- in the original languages, so Swahili or Kalenjin or \\n\\nwhatever the case may be.    Did they correspond, or did you notice any problems \\n\\nthere?   \\n\\nA.      [12:06:42] They corresponded. \\n\\nQ.      [12:06:45] Thank you, Mr Witness.     \\n\\nAll right.    I think you already confirmed this, but can I just draw your attention to \\n\\nthe items that are highlighted in purple.    And these run from item 84 to item 91.   \\n\\nThese are the transcripts of your evidence in the Ruto and Sang case.    You also \\n\\nconfirm that you read those?   \\n\\nA.      [12:07:28] Yes, I do.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:07:30] Now, Mr Witness, I\\'m going to ask you, do you have any objection if \\n\\nthese listed statements, in particular the ones that are highlighted in yellow and in \\n\\npurple, which are your prior statements in evidence and related annexes and \\n\\ndocuments, do you any objection if these are handed in to evidence in this case? \\n\\nA.      [12:07:55] I have no objection, my Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:07:58] Thank you very much, Mr Witness.    I\\'ll come back to the green \\n\\nhighlighted items, the audio visual items in a moment. \\n\\nNow, can I also ask you to have a look at the penultimate, the second to last item on \\n\\nthis list.    In fact, it\\'s the last item on this list.    It\\'s item 139.    It\\'s the witness \\n\\npreparation clarification log from the Ruto and Sang case.    Can you confirm that you \\n\\nhad an opportunity to again review that document? \\n\\nA.      [12:08:42] Yes, my Honour, I did.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:08:46] And can you confirm that those were clarifications that you made \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 44 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 45/97 SZ T\\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nduring the course of your witness preparation in that case with the Prosecution?   \\n\\nA.      [12:08:58] Yes, my Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:09:04] And did you also make certain further clarifications during the course \\n\\nof the witness preparation in this case?   \\n\\nA.      [12:09:14] Yes, my Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:09:17] All right. \\n\\nIf the Court will bear with me, please.   \\n\\nYour Honour, I\\'m -- I\\'m wanting to show the witness a copy of the witness \\n\\nclarifications in this case, but the document is not a short one.    It\\'s about six pages.    I \\n\\nwonder if whether it might be more efficient if I ask the witness to read this over \\n\\nthe lunch break, and then he can confirm after the break whether he agrees with these \\n\\nclarifications.    I think it is necessary because these were recorded by the Prosecution, \\n\\nand the witness has not yet had an opportunity to review them because it was done \\n\\nafter the Witness clarification session. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [12:10:17] Yes.    It would be good for the witness to \\n\\nread and understand and agree to whatever is stated therein.       \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [12:10:23] Yes.     \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [12:10:26] So we\\'ll do that after the lunch break. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [12:10:30] Thank you, your Honour.

[12:11:05] I do. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [12:11:06] Thank you, your Honour. \\n\\nYour Honour, the Prosecution will formally tender for admission into the case \\n\\nthe documents listed in this signed document -- well, in fact, I think I should probably \\n\\nrefer to the list of materials which I have provided to the Chamber and to counsel.   \\n\\nTherein I have indicated, the Prosecution has indicated those materials which \\n\\nthe Prosecution seeks to have formally admitted in the record of the case, which \\n\\ninclude the prior recorded testimony, the statements of the witness, but also his prior \\n\\nrecorded testimony in the Ruto and Sang case. \\n\\nIn this regard, however, your Honour, I should draw the Chamber\\'s attention to \\n\\nthe fact that the Prosecution did not formally request the admission of the prior \\n\\nrecorded testimony in the Ruto and Sang case in its Rule 68(3) application.    In fact, it \\n\\nstated in that application that the evidence of the witnesses in the Ruto and Sang case \\n\\nwas largely irrelevant.     \\n\\nWhile that might be correct in the case of Witness 613 and the other witness who was \\n\\nthe subject of that application is actually not correct in respect of this witness, who did \\n\\ngive significant and substantial testimony on the issues relevant to this case and \\n\\nthe Article 70 investigation in that matter. \\n\\nNow, the record of the testimony of all the relevant witnesses in that case has already \\n\\nbeen transferred into the record of this case, but, of course, that doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s \\n\\nformally submitted into evidence.     \\n\\nSo, with the leave of the Court, and subject to any comments my learned friend might \\n\\nhave, the Prosecution moves to also submit the prior recorded testimony of this \\n\\nwitness in the Ruto and Sang case.     \\n\\nIf it pleases the Court, I can at an appropriate time give more -- I can -- I can give \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 46 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 47/97 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nsome more -- more detail as to the relevant portions of that prior recorded testimony.   \\n\\nI can already tell the Chamber that, in so far as the direct examination of the witnesses, \\n\\nthe relevant portions are transcript 19 of the record in this case, at pages 38 to 85, and \\n\\ntranscript 27, pages 2 to 36.    That\\'s the direct evidence.    There may well also be \\n\\nrelevant portions under cross-examination, but I\\'m afraid I don\\'t have those \\n\\nrelevant -- those references to hand at the moment, but I can get them. \\n\\nYour Honour, if -- if that is acceptable to the Court, I do believe that the Prosecution \\n\\nwill be in a position to wrap up the direct evidence of this witness well within \\n\\nthe four and a half hours, and possibly even before the end of the day.    I have \\n\\nalready given my learned friends notice of the fact that it\\'s possible that we might -- I \\n\\nmight wrap up early.    So if they are prepared to commence their cross-examination, \\n\\nthey will be able to do so straight afterwards. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [12:14:25] Thank you. \\n\\nMay I ask, Mr Karnavas, do you have any take on that?   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [12:14:29] I do.    No objections.    The entire transcript can come \\n\\nin, all of his testimony, direct and cross. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [12:14:38] Thank you very much, Mr Karnavas, for \\n\\nyour understanding. \\n\\nYes, Mr Prosecutor. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [12:14:43] I confirm that the entire evidence then, direct and cross, \\n\\nthe Prosecution requests that that be admitted under Rule 68. \\n\\nVery well.    Formalities then attended to, let me move on. \\n\\nQ.      [12:15:05] Now, you\\'ve mentioned that you have given statements regarding \\n\\nwitness bribery.    And the evidence already now admitted into the record details \\n\\nthe fact that you were approached on more than one occasion with bribe offers. \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 47 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 48/97 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nI would like you to please describe to the Chamber in your own word, remembering \\n\\nto refer to the protected information list whenever you\\'re referring to a location or \\n\\na person that might identify you, how and by whom you were first approached to \\n\\nwithdraw as a Prosecution witness. \\n\\nA.      [12:15:58] My Honour, my very first approach was done by person number 2.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:16:39] And how was this approach made?    Was it in person, remotely, by \\n\\nmail?    How was it made?   \\n\\nA.      [12:16:54] It was done by -- by telephone and in person.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:17:02] All right.    Was the first approach in person or by telephone?   \\n\\nA.      [12:17:06] In person.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:17:08] The first approach was in person?    The first time you were contacted \\n\\nby person number 2?   \\n\\nA.      [12:17:19] I was contacted by -- by telephone, and thereafter we met.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:17:29] Thereafter you met in person? \\n\\nA.      [12:17:31] Thereafter we met in person. \\n\\nQ.      [12:17:33] All right.    And again referring to the protected information list, \\n\\nwhere were you at the time that you were approached by telephone by person \\n\\nnumber 2?       \\n\\nA.      [12:17:57] I was in place indicated location number 6.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:18:09] Thank you.    Now, I\\'m not going to -- well -- sorry.    Let me move on \\n\\nto my next question. \\n\\nDid you tell anyone about this approach?   \\n\\nA.      [12:18:25] Yes, my Honour.    I did report to the investigators of the -- of this \\n\\nCourt.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:18:36] All right.    And what did they ask you to do as a result of your report \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 48 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 49/97 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nto them of the bribery approach? \\n\\nA.      [12:18:49] I was asked to make sure that I record every conversation that I have \\n\\nwith this person.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:19:04] And what was your reaction to that request?   \\n\\nA.      [12:19:09] I accepted, my Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:19:15] And when you accepted, was any pressure put on you to accept, or \\n\\nwas this something you did voluntarily?   \\n\\nA.      [12:19:26] I did voluntarily, my Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:19:29] Why did you agree to do this?   \\n\\nA.      [12:19:37] Because I did not accept to see the case that was very important for \\n\\nthe victims of post-election violence fall like that, because of bribery and intimidations \\n\\nto the witnesses.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:20:00] Okay.    Now, I\\'m not going to take you through the details of that \\n\\noffer and through the subsequent contacts you had with person number 2 by \\n\\ntelephone since these are recorded in detail both in your prior statements, as well as \\n\\nin your evidence in the Ruto and Sang case.    And you\\'ve also identified and \\n\\ndescribed the contents of the recordings that you made with this witness.     \\n\\nBut perhaps this would be an opportune time to deal with the admission of these \\n\\ndocuments.    And perhaps I can just ask you again to look at the list of material that \\n\\nwas shown to you, the list that\\'s ticked by you, starting with the yellow highlights on \\n\\nthe left, and turning again to -- well, to page -- unfortunately, I haven\\'t given \\n\\npages here, have I?

And signify that by your ticks of the relevant item -- items.    Is that \\n\\ncorrect?   \\n\\nA.      [12:22:04] That is correct, my Honour. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [12:22:07] Your Honour, the Prosecution then will tender into \\n\\nevidence, submit into evidence all of these items.     \\n\\nIf I understand your Honour\\'s directions correctly, it\\'s not necessary to specify this \\n\\nnow, but we will send an email after the conclusion of the witness\\'s evidence \\n\\ndetailing all of these items.    They are also mentioned in the list that I\\'ve provided.    I \\n\\npresume that I\\'ve understood correctly the procedure. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [12:22:35] Yes, that\\'s correct.    So that at the end of his \\n\\ntestimony, we could give them evidence numbers and names.    We could mark them.   \\n\\nThank you. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [12:22:44] Very well.    Thank you.    Thank you, your Honour.   \\n\\nThis is my first time with a submission regime, so I\\'m also learning as we go. \\n\\nVery well.    Let me move on then.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:22:54] So after the series of phone calls with person number 2 that you \\n\\nrecorded and that we\\'ve just referred to, you\\'ve already told the Court that you met in \\n\\nperson.    Was this also at location number 6?   \\n\\nA.      [12:23:26] Yes, my Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:23:28] And just to set the scene, can you -- can you tell the Court how it came \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 50 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 51/97 SZ T\\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nabout that you met person number 2 in person at this location.   \\n\\nA.      [12:23:53] We did -- I did -- we did communicate on telephone with person \\n\\nnumber -- number 2 and agreed that he was going to come in person to location \\n\\nnumber 6 in order to have a meeting with me and possible other witnesses who were \\n\\nin the same location in order to agree on how we were going to recant all our \\n\\ntestimonies that were before this Court. \\n\\nQ.      [12:24:47] Okay.    Now just for the -- just for the public record, perhaps you can \\n\\nalso just mention to the Court, when the witness first contacted you, you say he \\n\\noffered you a bribe.    What was the bribe and for what purpose?    What did you have \\n\\nto do in return for this bribe?   \\n\\nA.      [12:25:14] If I agreed on the offer that he was giving as a bribe, I will agree to \\n\\nrecant all the testimonies that I gave before this Court and not to appear in this Court \\n\\nto give my testimony at any occasion that I was needed to appear.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:25:48] All right.    And just for the avoidance of doubt, the Prosecution \\n\\ninvestigators were aware of everything that you were discussing with the -- with \\n\\nperson number 2; is that correct? \\n\\nA.      [12:26:04] Yes, my Honour, I did record every conversation between me and \\n\\nperson number 2 and handed it to the investigators of this Court.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:26:16] All right.    Now, when you eventually met with -- with person \\n\\nnumber 2, and I -- I hope the -- well, it\\'s on -- it\\'s on record, so perhaps I can just lead \\n\\nthe witness as to the date, if there\\'s no objection from my learned friend. \\n\\nYour statements date the -- the -- these meetings with the -- person number 2 in \\n\\nlocation number 6 on (Redacted) , would you agree with that?   \\n\\nA.

And if I can ask you again to refer to the locations on the PIL.   \\n\\nA.      [12:27:31] On the first --   \\n\\nQ.      [12:27:34] On the first occasion.   \\n\\nA.      [12:27:36] On the first occasion, we met at place number 15. \\n\\nQ.      [12:27:41] And that was on (Redacted) ; is that correct? \\n\\nA.      [12:27:48] Yes, my Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:27:49] And in your own words - again just for the record, this was already \\n\\ndealt with in your statements and in your prior evidence, but for the public \\n\\nrecord - what was discussed at that first meeting with person number 2? \\n\\nA.      [12:28:09] On this date I tried my level best, because I was doing the recording, \\n\\nto make sure person number 2 gives me information concerning who sent him, how \\n\\nmuch he was going to offer and how we were -- I was -- what was my role that I was \\n\\nsupposed to do, he intended me to do, and how I will eventually get chance to go \\n\\nback home. \\n\\nQ.      [12:28:51] When you say \"go back home\", you mean to return to Kenya? \\n\\nA.      [12:28:55] Yes, my Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:28:56] All right.    Without giving away the location, then, location number 6, \\n\\ncan we assume, is outside of Kenya? \\n\\nA.      [12:29:05] Yes, my Honour. \\n\\nQ.

[12:29:27] I met with person number 2 on location number 15 on this date \\n\\nbecause he insisted that he wanted me -- he wanted to see me on -- at \\n\\nthat -- when -- when he arrived so that I could help him to get a place to spend a night \\n\\nand actually help him to locate a place to -- to -- and to get his food. \\n\\nMy Honour, I did accept to meet this person at place number 15.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:30:17] And what was the mode of transport that this person, person number \\n\\n2, used to get to location 15?   \\n\\nA.      [12:30:27] He used --   \\n\\nQ.      [12:30:31] Was it -- well, perhaps just say, was it private transport or public \\n\\ntransport? \\n\\nA.      [12:30:36] Public transport, my Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:30:39] All right.    And to your knowledge, was person number 2 familiar \\n\\nwith -- with location 6 and location 15?   \\n\\nA.      [12:30:51] Out of my discussion with him, I made my conclusion that he was not \\n\\nvery much conversant with the -- with the location, in terms of getting places to sleep \\n\\nand actually where to get his meals. \\n\\nQ.      [12:31:11] All right.    Now, this meeting -- well, let me ask you a preliminary \\n\\nquestion.    Were the investigators aware that person number 2 was coming to meet \\n\\nyou at location number 6?    Were they aware that he was travelling to location \\n\\nnumber 6 for the purposes of meeting you, should I say? \\n\\nA.      [12:31:37] Yes, they were aware that he was travelling.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:31:40] Were they aware of the fact that you were going to meet him on \\n\\n(Redacted) at location 15?   \\n\\nA.      [12:31:52] My Honour, I reported to the investigators that person number 2 \\n\\nwanted to see me on the said date, (Redacted) .    But I was told -- or I was requested \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 53 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 54/97 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nnot to see him on that date. \\n\\nQ.      [12:32:14] When were you supposed to meet him? \\n\\nA.      [12:32:16] The following day, my Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:32:20] All right.    And did the investigators say why they didn\\'t want you to \\n\\nmeet him on the (Redacted) ? \\n\\nA.      [12:32:32] Yes, my Honour.    They had -- the investigators had arranged where \\n\\nwe were going to meet. \\n\\nQ.      [12:32:41] All right.    And did you advise the investigators -- well, sorry.    Let \\n\\nme ask you then, despite this advice, you met with him.    Why did you agree to do \\n\\nthat?   \\n\\nA.      [12:32:53] My Honour, I want to confess that I did contrary to what \\n\\nthe investigators had requested me.    I took my own initiative to go and meet person \\n\\nnumber 2, because if I did not, he will have suspected that there is something fishy, \\n\\nbecause it was in the evening and there was no way I was -- I could not say I was \\n\\nanywhere else, like, say, in a meeting, or -- or have a cover-up story that I will give \\n\\nhim in order not to meet him that time.    Therefore, I took a big risk in order to \\n\\nkeep -- to keep him -- not to make him suspicious that there was anything that was \\n\\ngoing on in concern with what we had arranged, in order to get information that we \\n\\nwanted from him. \\n\\nQ.      [12:34:03] All right.    Now, you\\'ve previously told the Court that you were \\n\\nasked by the investigators to record each and every conversation you had with this \\n\\nperson.    Did you record the conversation on the (Redacted) ? \\n\\nA.      [12:34:16] Yes, my Honour.    I did not want anything that I was in conversation \\n\\nwith person number 2 to go and record it.    I recorded all the conversation that we \\n\\nhad with him during this time on the (Redacted) . \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 54 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 55/97 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nQ.      [12:34:31] You say you recorded all the conversation, the entire conversation; is \\n\\nthat correct? \\n\\nA.      [12:34:38] Yes, my Honour. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [12:34:41] Mr Steynberg, just a moment, please.    I just \\n\\nwant clarification by the witness.     \\n\\nMr Witness, you said location number 6 is outside Kenya; is that correct? \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [12:34:53] Yes, my Honour. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [12:34:56] Thank you very much. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:       \\n\\nQ.      [12:35:02] And perhaps, just for those who are unfamiliar with the area, and I \\n\\nthink this is a matter of public record, but is location number 15 a location within \\n\\nthe broader area of location number 6?   \\n\\nA.      [12:35:14] Yes, my Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:35:17] All right.    So it\\'s a specific location within location number 6? \\n\\nA.      [12:35:21] Yes, my Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:35:23] Okay.    And so you recorded all the conversation.    Did you provide \\n\\nthis recording to the investigators subsequently? \\n\\nA.      [12:35:31] Yes, my Honour.    I handed all the recordings to the investigators. \\n\\nQ.      [12:35:38] Okay.    I\\'ll return to that once I\\'ve dealt with the meetings of the next \\n\\nday. \\n\\nSo you\\'ve already told the Court that during this meeting you wanted to get \\n\\ninformation about who was sending the accused and those details.    What did \\n\\nthe accused tell you in that regard?    Who was -- who sent him?    Where was \\n\\nthe money coming from?    In your own words.    Again, this is all recorded in detail \\n\\nalready in your evidence, but --   \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 55 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 56/97 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [12:36:09] Mr Steynberg, do you mean the accused or \\n\\nperson number 2?   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [12:36:14] I beg your pardon.    Person number 2.    I misspoke.   \\n\\nThank you for the correction, your Honour.     \\n\\nQ.      What did person number 2 tell you about -- about the scheme, should I say, to \\n\\nbribe you?   \\n\\nA.      [12:36:38] I am trying to check on this list --   \\n\\nQ.      [12:36:40] Right.   \\n\\nA.      [12:36:41] -- if we have the name.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:36:46] All right.    Perhaps I can just mention to you that the names on this \\n\\nlist are only those names of people who are not known publicly.    So the names of \\n\\npublic personalities, as well as the names of persons involved in the case, such as \\n\\nthe accused, you will not find on the list.    And those can be mentioned in public. \\n\\nDoes that help you? \\n\\nA.      [12:37:18] Yes, my Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:37:20] All right.    Please proceed.   \\n\\nA.      [12:37:22] My Honour, person number 2 did confirm that the money was \\n\\nbeing -- being paid -- or will get -- or I will get the money from Mr Gicheru.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:37:49] Did you see Mr Gicheru here today?     \\n\\nIt might be difficult to see.    It\\'s a big courtroom.   \\n\\nA.      [12:38:01] Yes, my Honour.    He is the one seated over behind there. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [12:38:07] Pointing towards the accused, your Honour.   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [12:38:11] Thank you. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [12:38:12] \\n\\nQ.      [12:38:13] All right.    And did he tell you where the source of the money was \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 56 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 57/97 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nthat Mr Gicheru was going to pay you? \\n\\nA.      [12:38:24] Yes, my Honour.    Person number 2 did confirm to me that \\n\\nthe money was being gotten from Mr Ruto. \\n\\nQ.      [12:38:41] Just for the record, Mr William Ruto, the accused in the case where \\n\\nyou testified previously? \\n\\nA.      [12:38:48] Yes, my Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:38:50] Okay.    All right.    As I say, the -- further details of this conversation \\n\\nare recorded.    They are described in your statements in your prior testimony and \\n\\nalso clarified, and I don\\'t propose to go into any more detail at this stage. \\n\\nCan I move then to the following day, the next day.    How many times did you meet \\n\\nwith person number 2 on that day?   \\n\\nA.      [12:39:21] Person number 2, we did meet with him the following day, but we \\n\\nhad several short meetings with him on the same day, because at different instance he \\n\\nwould request me to go and look for person number - let me check on this list - for \\n\\nperson number 18, whom he believed that I was able to convince her to come on \\n\\nthe same meeting so that he -- she will also agree to recant her testimony. \\n\\nQ.      [12:40:18] And to your knowledge, what was person number 18\\'s involvement \\n\\nin the case, the Ruto and Sang case?   \\n\\nA.      [12:40:29] She was a witness too, my Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:40:33] And how do you know that?   \\n\\nA.      [12:40:36] Person number 18, we were working in the same organisation before I \\n\\nbecame a witness of this -- of this Court. \\n\\nQ.      [12:40:50] Perhaps while we\\'re on that subject, can you refer to the list of \\n\\norganisations and just clarify which organisation that was.   \\n\\nA.      [12:41:01] Organisation number 2, my Honour. \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 57 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 58/97 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nQ.      [12:41:05] I see.    And do you know how -- how person number 18 came to \\n\\nbecome an ICC witness?   \\n\\nA.      [12:41:23] Person number 18, I know her as a monitor of organisation number 2.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:41:32] All right.    I\\'m going to stop you there because I\\'m just concerned that \\n\\nyou\\'re going to give out some identifying information.    Let me rephrase \\n\\nthe question.     \\n\\nDo you know who introduced this person to the ICC?    Who put the ICC in contact \\n\\nwith this person, person number 18?   \\n\\nA.      [12:41:50] I did, my Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:41:53] I see.    And did you put any other persons in contact with the \\n\\nOffice of the Prosecutor of the ICC as potential witnesses?    Again referring to the list, \\n\\nplease.   \\n\\nA.      [12:42:09] Yes, my Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:42:11] Who? \\n\\nA.      [12:42:12] I did also introduce person number 16.    I also introduced person \\n\\nnumber -- number 2.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:42:24] Yes.    Anyone else?   \\n\\nA.      [12:42:45] Those are the ones I remember for now, my Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:42:50] All right.    Okay.    Let me move on then.     \\n\\nI just want to clarify one issue, and I\\'m conscious of the fact that you\\'re not testifying \\n\\nin your mother tongue.    English is not your -- is not your native language.    But you \\n\\nsaid earlier, when I asked you how many times you had met with person number 2 \\n\\non the -- on the second date, you said, \"We had met him.    We had several short \\n\\nmeetings with person number 2.\"     \\n\\nWho are you referring to when you said \"we had meetings with person number 2\"?   \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 58 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 59/97 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nWas there anyone else besides yourself, perhaps I should say? \\n\\nA.      [12:43:34] No, it was only me and him.     \\n\\nQ.      [12:43:35] I see. \\n\\nA.      [12:43:36] That\\'s why I referred it as \"we\". \\n\\nQ.      [12:43:39] All right.    I think that sufficiently clarifies it.     \\n\\nAnd again, without giving the specific -- well, in fact, you can possibly -- yes.    With \\n\\nreference to this list, can you tell specifically where in location number 6 you met him \\n\\non the second date, if you recall the name.   \\n\\nA.      [12:44:23] I don\\'t recall the name of that hotel now, my Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:44:27] Okay.    You say it was a hotel.   \\n\\nA.      [12:44:30] Yes, my Honour.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:44:31] And where in the hotel?    In the reception, at the reception desk, in \\n\\nthe lobby, in a room?    Where was it?   \\n\\nA.      [12:44:39] In an open area inside the building. \\n\\nQ.      [12:44:43] I see.   \\n\\nA.      [12:44:45] There were -- there were set chairs on -- where people could get \\n\\na drink, and -- and we had -- we had -- we sat in one of the place.    There were also \\n\\nplaces on top, on the -- on the upper ground. \\n\\nQ.      [12:44:59] All right.    Now I\\'m going to ask you to have a look at a photograph.   \\n\\nIf the Court will bear with me.    I\\'ll ask the court officer to call up a photograph \\n\\nfor -- for sight only within the courtroom, please, not for public broadcast.    It\\'s \\n\\nKEN-OTP-0111-0159.    Your Honours, you will find this at tab 29 of the binders that \\n\\nthe Prosecution has provided. \\n\\nI\\'m not seeing it.    I\\'m perhaps on the wrong channel.     \\n\\nIs everyone else seeing it yet?   \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 59 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 60/97 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nA.      [12:46:21] Yes, my Honour, I can see the photos.    I confirm these are the photos \\n\\nof me and person number 2.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:46:34] All right. \\n\\nIf your Honour will bear with me.    I can\\'t see it, so I\\'m clearly --   \\n\\nTHE COURT OFFICER:    [12:46:39] The material is on evidence channel 1. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [12:46:43] That was the next button.    Thank you.       \\n\\nQ.      [12:46:47] Sorry.    I missed that in all the commotion.    You say you \\n\\nconfirm -- who\\'s in the photograph? \\n\\nA.      [12:46:54] Before me, on my -- on my right is myself, and on my left is person \\n\\nnumber 2. \\n\\nQ.      [12:46:59] All right.    I think photograph number 2 is probably the clearest.   \\n\\nYou say that\\'s you on the right and person number 2 on the left of that photograph.   \\n\\nThat\\'s photograph number 2 of the document I have called up, titled \"Annex H\"? \\n\\nA.      [12:47:17] Yes, my Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:47:18] And do you recognise the location where this photograph is taken?   \\n\\nWithout mentioning the name, is this the location where you met? \\n\\nA.      [12:47:28] Yes. \\n\\nQ.      [12:47:29] That you\\'ve just described? \\n\\nA.      [12:47:30] Yes, my Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [12:47:31] All right.    Do you know who took the photograph? \\n\\nA.      [12:47:37] The investigators did take the photographs. \\n\\nQ.      [12:47:40] Okay.    Thank you. \\n\\nThen again, because you\\'ve gone through this in detail and we have the recordings, \\n\\ncan you just describe or summarise what was discussed at this meeting.   \\n\\nA.      [12:48:00] My Honour, at this meeting, it was a continuation of what we had \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 60 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 61/97 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\ndiscussed on the 20th.    And I continued to ask in detail who was going to provide \\n\\nthe money and if, truly, that money was available.    I wanted to know who was \\n\\ninvolved in this process where witnesses were being asked to recant so that I could \\n\\nactually know and keep it in the record to hand it to the investigators.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:48:57] Now, you said you were asked to locate some other witnesses, \\n\\nincluding person number 18.    How many people did you discuss with person \\n\\nnumber 2 that you would locate for him?   \\n\\nA.      [12:49:18] Person number 2 wanted me to locate person number 18.    We also \\n\\ndiscussed for other witnesses who were in another country, and he was \\n\\nsupposed -- he told me on his plans to go and locate those -- those ones that were \\n\\naway. \\n\\nQ.      [12:50:05] All right.    The witness who was in another country, is that location \\n\\non the list?    That country, should I say.   \\n\\nA.      [12:50:31] I don\\'t see. \\n\\nQ.      [12:50:32] Okay, never mind.    We can clarify then in private session, if \\n\\nnecessary. \\n\\nAll right.    Now -- in fact, let me leave that and move on.    I think there\\'s sufficient \\n\\nevidence on this point on record already. \\n\\nSo after this series of meetings, you\\'ve said that you handed over the recordings to \\n\\nthe investigators.

Okay? \\n\\nTHE WITNESS:    [12:51:44] My apologies, my Honour. \\n\\nAt every break I took with person number 2 after recording, I found cover story to tell \\n\\nhim in order to get a break to go and hand the part of recording that I had done to \\n\\nthe investigators.    And during that time is when I was telling him that I\\'m going to \\n\\nlook for person number 18.    That time that I went out from the meeting, for him, he \\n\\nknew I was going to locate person number 18.    But, actually, I was going to give out \\n\\nthe recordings to the investigators in order for the space of recordings to be freed.   \\n\\nAnd I get back to the -- to the meeting to continue to get more information from \\n\\nperson number 2. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [12:52:51] \\n\\nQ.      [12:52:51] And then did -- I presume the investigators then downloaded or \\n\\notherwise extracted this information from your device into their records; is that right? \\n\\nA.      [12:53:02] Yes, my Honour.    I did see the investigators download the recording \\n\\nto their computers, and I did sign documents to verify that I had seen that done.   \\n\\nQ.      [12:53:23] All right.    Now, in this process, was the recording from the previous \\n\\nday also downloaded by the investigators?   \\n\\nA.      [12:53:33] Yes, my Honour.    All the recordings were downloaded. \\n\\nQ.      [12:53:38] Did you specifically mention at that time that in addition to the -- to \\n\\nthe recordings of the meetings on the second day, there was also a recording of \\n\\na meeting the previous day that you were handing to the investigators?    Did you tell \\n\\nthem that?   \\n\\nA.

[15:46:28] Thank you.    In fact, one of the issues I had actually \\n\\nproposed to do in public session I\\'ve dealt with now, so -- but perhaps it was best to, \\n\\nin any event, do that in private session. \\n\\nSo all that really remains then, your Honour, is to ask the witness to confirm in \\n\\nthe public session what you told us in private session, that you\\'ve read the witness \\n\\nclarification log from your witness preparation last week over the lunch break.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:46:59] Is that correct? \\n\\nA.      [15:47:00] Yes, my Honour. \\n\\nQ.      [15:47:01] And is -- is that an accurate record of the clarifications you made?   \\n\\nWas there anything you\\'d like to change?   \\n\\nA.      [15:47:30] Yeah, the -- the spelling of -- of number 17, KEN-OTP-0142-0699.   \\n\\nQ.      [15:47:45] All right.    We\\'re in public session now.    Is that -- is that something \\n\\nyou can mention in public session?    No? \\n\\nA.      [15:47:53] No. \\n\\nQ.      [15:47:54] Can I ask you, I think the easiest is, if you -- do you have a pen with \\n\\nyou? \\n\\nA.      [15:48:02] No. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [15:48:03] Can the court officer please provide the witness with \\n\\na pen, and can he just write the correct spelling in the margin next to that, and we will \\n\\nadmit that exhibit into court.   \\n\\nIn fact, I -- I can probably put this on the record without context.    It\\'s the name of \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 94 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 95/97 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\na location.    It\\'s a location which is not relevant to any of the -- to any of the issues \\n\\nthat have been discussed by the witness today.    So it\\'s easiest if I probably just -- no, I \\n\\nwon\\'t.    It would be safer not to.    I beg your pardon, your Honour. \\n\\nSo this witness preparation log, your Honour, will then be entered into evidence, will \\n\\nbe registered and given an evidence number, along with the clarification log.   \\n\\nThe Ruto and Sang one already has one.    And then we will add that to the list of \\n\\nitems to be added -- to be submitted formally into the record of the case.    So I will \\n\\nhang on to this because we need to register it and give it an ERN number.    Is that all \\n\\nright? \\n\\nI mean, the only thing is that this has witness\\'s physical correction on it, so there\\'s \\n\\nonly one of these. \\n\\nAnd the witness has signed it.    And I will return the original to -- to the court officer \\n\\nin the morning, if that\\'s -- if that\\'s in order.    All right? \\n\\nI see the court officer seems to be happy with that arrangement. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [15:50:51] Yes, I think that\\'s okay. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [15:50:53] Thank you. \\n\\nOne final matter, your Honour.    I mentioned -- and I\\'ll be careful what I say, but I \\n\\nmentioned an affidavit and a letter during the private session that were provided that \\n\\nwere -- yes, provided to the Prosecution.    Those documents came under cover of \\n\\na letter from the attorney concerned, which this witness would not have seen.    But I \\n\\nthink I would also like to introduce into -- into evidence -- they\\'re actually part of \\n\\nthe same series of documents, but they were, unfortunately, omitted from the list. \\n\\nPerhaps I can just read into the record the ERN number.    It\\'s KEN-OTP-0145-0566.   \\n\\nAnd it\\'s a letter from person -- a firm of attorneys, including person number 25 on \\n\\nthe list.    And it is dated 30 August 2013.    I think that will sufficiently identify it.     \\n\\n15.02.2022 \\n\\nPage 95 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-050-Red-ENG WT 15-02-2022 96/97 SZ T\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nOpening Statements and Trial Hearing              (Open Session)                                            ICC-01/09-01/20 \\nWITNESS: KEN-OTP-P-0800 \\n\\nAnd I have shown this document to my learned friend.

Thank you. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:32:55] Thank you very much.     \\n\\nWell, my name is Miatta Maria Samba and I am the judge assigned to this case.    The \\n\\npurpose of this status conference is to discuss the preparation of the trial in order to \\n\\nhave all the necessary information to decide on the start date for the trial.    The \\n\\nChamber will render a written decision on this matter in due course.     \\n\\nIn this regard, I note the submissions of the parties made on the 10 September this \\n\\nyear, which I am grateful for.    I have studied those submissions, so I ask the parties \\n\\nnot to repeat them in the courtroom and only provide information which has not yet \\n\\nbeen covered in the written filings.    I first want to say some words on the manner in \\n\\nwhich the Chamber will conduct these proceedings.     \\n\\nFirst, the Chamber expects that before the parties seize the Chamber with a request, \\n\\nall reasonable efforts would have been made to resolve the issue inter partes or with \\n\\n24.09.2021 \\n\\nPage 2 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-048-Red-ENG WT 24-09-2021 3/32 SZ T\\n\\nStatus Conference                                              (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nthe Registry as the case may be.    The Chamber may reject a request for relief sought \\n\\nin limine if such efforts have not been undertaken.    To this end, the Chamber expects \\n\\nthe parties to cooperate procedurally in order to achieve efficiency and expedition of \\n\\nthis trial.    Such cooperation - and I emphasise this, too - does not in any way affect \\n\\nthe fairness of the trial or the onus on the Prosecution to prove its case and not indeed \\n\\ninfringe on -- upon the rights of the accused person.     \\n\\nSecond, the Chamber will only deal with motions that formalise a specific request for \\n\\nrelief.    Therefore, the parties are discouraged from making general observations \\n\\nwithout any relief requested or announcements that a relief might be requested in the \\n\\nfuture. \\n\\nThirdly, the Chamber stresses the importance of the publicity of the proceedings.   \\n\\nThe parties and the Registry are expected to make a serious effort to make all of their \\n\\nsubmissions publicly.    Should that really not be possible, you are expected to file a \\n\\npublic redacted version at the same time as the original.    References to confidential \\n\\nfilings can be made publicly as long as they do not reveal the information which gave \\n\\nrise to the classification as confidential.    When applying redactions to filings, the \\n\\nparties must keep in mind that there needs to be a specific justification for not \\n\\nrevealing the information to the public.    The mere wish by a party not to divulge \\n\\ninformation to the public at large is not a sufficient reason.     \\n\\nFinally, the Chamber stresses that the classification ex parte should only be used in \\n\\nexceptional circumstances.    Most importantly, it should not be abused to gain \\n\\naccusatorial advantage by excluding the other party.     \\n\\nSo that said, the Chamber is attuned to the security concerns that have been voiced by \\n\\nthe parties.    It assures the parties that this Chamber will do everything possible and \\n\\nfeasible to ensure the safety of the witnesses and everyone involved in these \\n\\n24.09.2021 \\n\\nPage 3 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-048-Red-ENG WT 24-09-2021 4/32 SZ T\\n\\nStatus Conference                                              (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nproceedings.    It will continue to monitor -- it will continue to monitor ongoing \\n\\nsituations and remain vigilant to any information which is brought to its attention.   \\n\\nIn this vein, the Chamber urges the parties to remain mindful of what is said in open \\n\\nsession.    Also, in light of the instructions provided by the Chamber in its email of \\n\\nSeptember 22, you should therefore request a private session whenever you deem it \\n\\nwould otherwise not be possible to provide the Chamber with all the necessary \\n\\ninformation.    This equally applies to today\\'s hearing.    Finally, a small but important \\n\\nlogistical point.    I kindly remind the parties to respect the five-seconds rule and to \\n\\nspeak slowly when making oral submissions so as to assist the interpreters.     \\n\\nThese were my few opening remarks.    Now, let\\'s discuss the specific items as \\n\\nannounced by the Chamber\\'s email to the parties. \\n\\nFirst, the Chamber informs the parties that the protocols which have been issued \\n\\nduring the Pre-Trial phase of the proceedings will continue to have effect until they \\n\\nare amended by the Chamber.    The Chamber will also issue a decision on the issue \\n\\nof how witnesses will be prepared before providing their testimony in due course.     \\n\\nSo now moving to disclosure.    And before we get into specifics, I would like to make \\n\\na few general remarks regarding disclosure.    Firstly, I wish to emphasise that I \\n\\nexpect the Prosecution to complete its disclosure in a timely manner.    Similarly, the \\n\\nChamber expects that any request for disclosure should be discussed between the \\n\\nparties before rulings are sought from the Chamber.    In this regard, it is incumbent \\n\\non the Prosecution to give proper reasons if they\\'re going to refuse a request for \\n\\ndisclosure. \\n\\nFinally, the Chamber also wishes to remind the Prosecution that it has an ongoing \\n\\nobligation to disclose exculpatory evidence to the Defence and this should be done in \\n\\na timely manner.     \\n\\n24.09.2021 \\n\\nPage 4 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-048-Red-ENG WT 24-09-2021 5/32 SZ T\\n\\nStatus Conference                                              (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nTurning to some specific questions, the Chamber notes that the Prosecution submitted \\n\\nthat its, and I quote, \"It has completed its analysis of the review required in order to \\n\\nmeet its obligations under Article 67(2) and Rule 77.\"    End of quote.    And I quote \\n\\nagain, \"Has already disclosed what is assessed to be the most relevant evidence \\n\\ndisclosable under these provisions prior to the confirmation of the charges.\"    End of \\n\\nquotes. \\n\\nSo in order for the Chamber to have the full picture, I have three concerns.    First, \\n\\ncould the Prosecution, Mr Steynberg, please confirm that it disclosed to the Defence \\n\\nthe bulk and the most relevant items in July 2021 at the latest?    How many items \\n\\nhave been disclosed in the meantime? \\n\\nSecond, the Prosecution mentioned that there are discussions with the Defence on \\n\\nkeywords or lines of Defence in order to focus the review and be more efficient. \\n\\nCould you give an update on these discussions, Mr Prosecutor?    And lastly, the \\n\\nProsecution states in paragraph 8 of each submissions that its, and I quote, \"Must \\n\\nfinalise its review.\"    End of quote.    What is the status of the review?    I noticed the \\n\\nProsecution\\'s disclosure notice, which was filed yesterday, and that 435 items that \\n\\nwere disclosed as incriminating, exonerating and under Rule 77.    So I see that the \\n\\nprocess is well underway.    Please provide further details on this matter?    How \\n\\nmany items were already reviewed and how many are still outstanding?   \\n\\nMr Prosecutor, please. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [9:42:33] Yes, thank you, your Honour.    Perhaps as an initial \\n\\ncomment regarding your Honour\\'s observations about the need for inter partes \\n\\ncooperation, I can just assure the Chamber that we have been in constructive \\n\\ndiscussions with the Defence.    Indeed we are fortunate to have such an experienced \\n\\nDefence team who appear to -- well, in fact, have given the assurances that they will \\n\\n24.09.2021 \\n\\nPage 5 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-048-Red-ENG WT 24-09-2021 6/32 SZ T\\n\\nStatus Conference                                              (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nconduct a focused Defence and we are exploring ways in which we can streamline the \\n\\nprocedure.     \\n\\nAs mentioned in my filing, we are in discussions about a possible agreement on \\n\\nevidence.    We\\'ll give you more details in due course, and we do hope that we\\'ll be \\n\\nable to further streamline the procedure in line with the intention of the drafts of the \\n\\nStatute that Rule 7 -- sorry, Article 70 procedures should be more streamlined and \\n\\nconducted expeditiously. \\n\\nTurning to a few of the other issues which your Honour has raised.    On the issue of \\n\\nthe decision that your Honour has indicated you will provide on -- in due course on \\n\\nwitness preparation, the Prosecution has indicated that the two parties have -- or are \\n\\nin -- have common cause that witness preparation should be permitted.    In the event \\n\\nthat your Honour wishes to have further legal submissions on this issue, we will \\n\\nobviously be grateful to provide those.    We had not really made any substantive \\n\\nsubmissions on that.     \\n\\nAs regards the disclosure, the Prosecution obviously takes to heart your Honours \\n\\nadmonitions about the disclosure obligations of the Prosecution.    We are aware of \\n\\ndisclosure obligations and we are doing our best to meet them in a timely fashion.     \\n\\nOn the three specific concerns you\\'ve raised, your Honour, yes, I can confirm that the \\n\\nProsecution has disclosed what it -- what it considers to be the most relevant evidence.   \\n\\nAnd perhaps I can just give a little bit of detail as to the basis in which I make this \\n\\nstatement, that is, that the Prosecution has organised its disclosure review in such a \\n\\nway that with the knowledge of its own case, and with the best information it has \\n\\nabout the Defence\\'s case it has identified the items that it considered to be the most \\n\\nrelevant to this specific case.    However, disclosure obligations obviously do not end \\n\\nthere.

There\\'s been a double counting. \\n\\nAs regards the discussions on keywords, perhaps discussion isn\\'t -- isn\\'t really the \\n\\ncorrect description.    The Prosecution has invited the Defence to provide its keywords \\n\\nand themes already at the pre-confirmation stage.    We\\'ve not really had any further \\n\\ndiscussions on it.    The invitation stands and I\\'m sure the Defence will -- will be in a \\n\\nbetter position to advise the Chamber where they are with that. \\n\\nFinally, I should just inform the Chamber - in lieu of the Chamber\\'s instruction that \\n\\ndiscussions should be had regarding disclosure issues - that the Defence has, over the \\n\\ncourse of the proceedings, sent several disclosure requests which have been dealt \\n\\nwith inter partes to date.    There are two pending that were sent - I think it was the \\n\\nweek before last - and that the Prosecution are still working on.    We hope to respond \\n\\nto my learned friends as soon as possible.    Of course, there have been other pressing \\n\\nissues in terms of urgent filings that the Prosecution has been dealing with in the \\n\\ninterim, as well as the preparation for the proceedings.   \\n\\nYour Honour, I hope have I sufficiently addressed the items that you have raised, but \\n\\nif I have missed anything, please do let me know and I\\'ll attempt to address those, \\n\\n24.09.2021 \\n\\nPage 7 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-048-Red-ENG WT 24-09-2021 8/32 SZ T\\n\\nStatus Conference                                              (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\ntoo. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:48:41] Yes.    Mr Steynberg, while you\\'re still on \\n\\nyour legs, I had referred to paragraph 8 of your submissions where you said words to \\n\\nthe effect that, I quote, \"must still finalise its review\".    What is the status of that \\n\\nreview?   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [9:49:01] Your Honour, that review is still at a fairly early stage.   \\n\\nThose numbers that were given in our submissions on the 10th were the numbers \\n\\noutstanding at that date.    So it\\'s 14 days since we made those filings.    The -- what \\n\\nthe Prosecution has done is it has secured additional resources in terms of contracted \\n\\nlegal reviewers who are working full time on this, as well as the rest of the \\n\\nProsecution team which, unfortunately, is not a large one.    It\\'s what you see before \\n\\nyou today, plus two other lawyers who remain in -- in the office -- sorry, three other \\n\\nlawyers, I beg your pardon.     \\n\\nSo the figures that I have are that since the date of the filing 1,914 items have been \\n\\nreviewed, and I\\'ve already given you the figures for those that have been disclosed \\n\\nsince then.    There are also others that are sitting in the next disclosure packages and \\n\\nthey will be processed as soon as that\\'s possible. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:50:11] Thank you very much, Mr Steynberg.     \\n\\nI now give the floor to the Defence.     \\n\\nMr Karnavas, it would be helpful if you could indicate how much time you will need \\n\\nto prepare after the OTP has disclosed all incriminating evidence.    The Chamber \\n\\nunderstands that the bulk of the Prosecution\\'s evidence has already been in your \\n\\npossession for several months now and that any additions will be limited in terms of \\n\\nvolume. \\n\\nCould you please elaborate as to why you would need three months between the date \\n\\n24.09.2021 \\n\\nPage 8 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-048-Red-ENG WT 24-09-2021 9/32 SZ T\\n\\nStatus Conference                                              (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nof full disclosure and the start of trial?   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [9:50:57] Thank you, your Honour.     \\n\\nFirst, let me begin by saying we totally agree with your general observations and \\n\\nthat\\'s how we have been proceeding thus far.    We have good communications with \\n\\nthe Prosecution.    However, as you noted, yesterday we received 435 documents.     \\n\\nNow, what you see here is the Defence team.    Over there, there is a Roman legion of \\n\\nlawyers and experts and what have you and so we are at a disadvantage.    I don\\'t \\n\\nknow what more evidence is coming our way.    Three months is not an unusual \\n\\namount of time.    What the Prosecutor considers relevant is -- is a relevant term.   \\n\\nWhat he thinks may or may not be essential to the Defence is somewhat -- is -- is also \\n\\nquestionable.    There also are expert reports that we are expecting from the \\n\\nProsecution, an item that is being examined.    As I understand it, they indicated one, \\n\\npossibly two more.    The Prosecution\\'s representations are that they -- these reports \\n\\nshould be available to us by the first of December, if I\\'m not mistaken.    Obviously, \\n\\nwe will need to -- to exam those.    We may need to secure our own expert to review \\n\\nthose documents. \\n\\nAlso, the Prosecution has indicated that they\\'re in the process of continuing to \\n\\ninvestigate and that there may be three additional witnesses that may have - I believe \\n\\nthe word was used – (Redacted).    If I\\'m mistaken, I can be corrected by   \\n\\nthe gentleman. \\n\\nSo we -- there has been quite -- quite a bit of disclosure information.    We -- we are \\n\\nworking diligently on this.    We did send two letters back in September 8 and 9 \\n\\nrequesting some additional information.    We\\'re hoping that we get, you know, more \\n\\nor less what we\\'re asking for.    Barring that, we may need to file a motion to compel \\n\\ndisclosure.    We\\'re hoping that we don\\'t have to do that.    I am of the firm belief that \\n\\n24.09.2021 \\n\\nPage 9 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-048-Red-ENG WT 24-09-2021 10/32 SZ T\\n\\nStatus Conference                                              (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\ncourtroom time and the Judge\\'s time should be spent on the case and not fighting \\n\\ndisputes that can be resolved easily among the parties and which the rules especially \\n\\nprovide resolution for without contention. \\n\\nSo I think given that they\\'re continuing to investigate, if yesterday\\'s any indication \\n\\nthat there\\'s more documents of that nature - and we\\'re talking about 435 documents, \\n\\nwe\\'re not talking about pages, we\\'re talking documents - we want to digest it.    We \\n\\nwant a fair trial, we want a fair process.    We understand that they\\'re expecting us to \\n\\nprovide them with keywords, but I -- this is not my first trial, nor is it the Prosecutor\\'s \\n\\nfirst trial.    He knows the case.    He knows what\\'s exculpatory.    He knows what\\'s \\n\\nrelevant.    He doesn\\'t need, you know, a modest defence lawyer to tell him exactly \\n\\nwhat his case is all about and what he should be disclosing to us. \\n\\nSo I\\'ll leave it at that.    I do want to say one -- make one short remark concerning \\n\\nwitness preparation.    And I\\'m getting ahead of ourselves at this point.     \\n\\nIn principle, we are -- we both agree that witness preparation is -- is essential.   \\n\\nHowever, what I have seen, the modalities that I have seen thus far are highly \\n\\ndisadvantageous to the Defence when they do allow preparation in that, one, even \\n\\nthough there\\'s a videotape requirement it\\'s not automatically turned over.    You \\n\\nwould only get it up to 24 hours beforehand.    Again, with a modest team, we don\\'t \\n\\nhave that opportunity.    Documents can be shown to a witness that were not known \\n\\nto the witness.    I have a problem with that because the witnesses\\' evidence is what\\'s \\n\\nin their memory.    And when we begin to tamper with someone\\'s memory we\\'re \\n\\ntampering with the evidence.    So I would strongly advise against that.    And I have \\n\\nrecently seen modalities that -- in another Trial Chamber adopted, the Yekatom Trail \\n\\nChamber, and I think that they provide all the necessary modalities required for a \\n\\nwitness to familiarise themselves with whatever statements they have made to know \\n\\n24.09.2021 \\n\\nPage 10 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-048-Red-ENG WT 24-09-2021 11/32 SZ T\\n\\nStatus Conference                                              (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/20 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nwhat\\'s going to happen in the courtroom without the need of having a lawyer \\n\\nactually preparing them in a sense.    Because once you start going down that road, \\n\\ndepending on the quality and the experience of the lawyer they can easily transgress, \\n\\ntrans -- trespass into the area of coaching inadvertently as it may be.    In any event, \\n\\nthose are my remarks, your Honour.    I hope I answered your question. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:56:49] Thank you very much, Mr Karnavas.     \\n\\nAs I said, there will be a ruling in respect of how the witnesses would present their \\n\\ntestimonies to the Court, so that one will come out subsequently.    But may I ask, \\n\\nMr Karnavas, again, before -- if may I ask, do you have an intention to do any \\n\\ninvestigations?   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [9:57:14] Okay.    As you may appreciate, your Honour, from the \\n\\nvery moment that we got into the case, we\\'re investigating in a sense.    We\\'re looking \\n\\ninto -- we\\'re reviewing the documents, so I don\\'t want to go beyond that.    I can \\n\\nassure the Court that we\\'re not going to be asking for additional time.    I think \\n\\nthe -- if the Prosecutor has represented that March 1 is a good date for them and \\n\\nprovided that they provide us with the disclosure material, that would be sufficient \\n\\nfor us bar some -- some unexpected event.    But I don\\'t want to go into the specifics of \\n\\nwhat we are doing in preparation, but I can assure Her Honour that we are being \\n\\nexceptionally diligent as we normally are in all cases. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [9:58:15] Thank you very much, Mr Karnavas.    But \\n\\nthe Chamber would need sufficient detailed information, if you may, on which \\n\\nspecific investigations you believe you need to be able to carry out before we can start \\n\\nhearing the Prosecution\\'s witnesses. \\n\\nSo please also provide a realistic timeline for when you expect to be ready with these \\n\\ninvestigations.

You said in paragraph 26 of your written submission that you still \\n\\nneed to complete the review and analysis of certain electronic data. \\n\\nCould the Prosecution provide an update on this, please?    The Chamber would like \\n\\nto know more about the timeline.    Is this process being finalised, Mr Steynberg?     \\n\\nAnd I have another question in that respect, if I may. \\n\\nThe second question is with regard the Prosecution\\'s attempt to obtain further \\n\\nevidence.    Could the Prosecution also provide an update on this?    Was a final \\n\\ndecision made on whether to call further witnesses?

I have a couple of questions on that, \\n\\nMr Steynberg.     \\n\\nFirst, when does the Prosecution intend to make this decision?

Does the \\n\\nProsecution envisage any specific problems? \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [10:06:22] Your Honour, the decision whether or not we need to \\n\\ncall these witnesses is also -- is firstly contingent upon the proposed agreement of \\n\\nfacts which we are in the process of discussing with the Defence.    The Prosecution \\n\\nhas proposed that we might reach an agreement on -- on the admission of this \\n\\nmaterial or at least the authenticity and reliability of the material.    If that decision is \\n\\nnot reached, and to the extent that the Prosecution feels it needs to rely on the \\n\\ncontents of this phone, which at this stage it believes it probably will, the -- you know, \\n\\nif we put to the proof, we will then obviously need to -- we will need to prove the \\n\\nprocess by which the information was extracted and the authenticity and reliability of \\n\\nthe data itself. \\n\\nNow, the -- the reason why more than one witness may be necessary is that more than \\n\\none body was involved in the process.    The phone was initially examined by the \\n\\nProsecution\\'s in-house expert in the forensic science section, but in relation to a \\n\\ncertain category of information they were not able to retrieve the data with the tools \\n\\nat their -- at their disposal and, therefore, a request was made to an outside agency to \\n\\nassist with this.    So to the extent that this data is retrieved by two agencies, it may be \\n\\nnecessary for each to testify in this regard.   \\n\\nThe third witness, again, if necessary, does not pertain to this device, but rather to the \\n\\naudio enhancement of certain recordings that were made in the process of the \\n\\nProsecution\\'s investigation.    Certain of these recordings have already been enhanced.   \\n\\nWe\\'ve received the -- the enhanced audio and we\\'re now in the process of reviewing \\n\\nthe transcripts of that material.    These transcripts have already been disclosed to the \\n\\nDefence.

Not really.    I just have to \\n\\nwait and see.    I think after this hearing I look forward to sitting down with the \\n\\ngentleman and going over and see to what extent we might be able to reach any \\n\\nagreements.    I\\'m of the firm belief that when it comes to this sort of information it is \\n\\nterribly important for the Prosecution or the moving party to lay a proper foundation.   \\n\\nSo it might be even if - and it\\'s a big if - we were to reach some accommodation, at \\n\\nleast one, perhaps two experts would -- would be required.     \\n\\nNow, if the reports are -- are comprehensive and detailed, it may not be necessary.   \\n\\nYou know, we would take the expert at the report.    If, on the other hand, there \\n\\nwould be a need for confrontation, you know, that\\'s a different matter.    But at least \\n\\nmy approach and advocacy is not to just, you know, swat every mosquito with a \\n\\ncannon ball.    So that\\'s it.   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [10:10:56] Your Honour, if I may just add something I omitted to \\n\\nadd.

The Prosecution announces \\n\\nthat it will file requests under Rule 68(3) by the 1 December of this year.    You also \\n\\nforeshadow that you intend to file applications under Rule 68(2) of the Rules.    May I \\n\\nask the Prosecution why it argues that it is only possible to file these applications on \\n\\n1 December?    Couldn\\'t you file these requests at least for the witnesses you certainly \\n\\nintend to call at an earlier date?     \\n\\nMr Steynberg, please.   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [10:12:06] Your Honour, anything is possible.    It\\'s a question of, \\n\\nyou know, competing obligations, deadlines, et cetera.    There is no, in principle, \\n\\nreason why we couldn\\'t file it earlier than that, but of course decisions on exactly \\n\\nwhat to do and what to request to do are best made when one has a complete picture \\n\\nof the -- the case it intends to present.    We have a fairly good idea where we\\'re going \\n\\nalready, but there still are outstanding investigations, there still are -- there still is \\n\\nmaterial that needs to be reviewed, so the Prosecution would not want to be \\n\\nprecipitous in these requests only to find later that they\\'re not necessary.    But I do \\n\\nbelieve that some time before 1 December would be feasible, but, you know, not as \\n\\nsoon as next week.   \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:13:23] Thank you very much, Mr Steynberg. \\n\\nDoes the Defence, Mr Karnavas, do you have anything to say in respect of his \\n\\nsubmissions?   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:13:31] Yes, I do.    And my heart goes out to the Prosecution.   \\n\\n24.09.2021 \\n\\nPage 17 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-048-Red-ENG WT 24-09-2021 18/32 SZ T\\n\\nStatus Conference                                              (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/15 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nThey\\'re so overwhelmed with this and what have you.    They\\'ve only been working \\n\\non this case for the last five years or so.    It would seem to me that by now they \\n\\nshould know what their case is about.    Now, we\\'re here by their invitation.    That\\'s \\n\\nhow I look at the charging document and where we are today.    They should know \\n\\ntheir case.    This is not a complex case as cases go.    They\\'re talking about 12, 14, 16 \\n\\nwitnesses.    Of those, half of them they wish to avail themselves to these particular \\n\\nrules.    It would seem to me that by November 1 they should be able to provide that \\n\\ninformation.     \\n\\nNow, I understand they have to juggle all sorts of balls in the air and what have you, \\n\\nbut imagine the Defence side getting those at the last -- you know, on December 1 and \\n\\nthen having to do all the other preparation and having to respond to this.    It would \\n\\nseem to me that if they know who their witnesses are, and they do know, I mean it\\'s \\n\\nnot -- this is not rocket science, with all due respect.    They -- and they know what \\n\\nthey want to adduce from these witnesses.    They know what sort of documentary \\n\\nevidence they want to use with these witnesses.    Why pray tell?    Can they not move \\n\\nmore expeditiously?     \\n\\nMay I remind the Court that Mr Gicheru contacted the Prosecution well in advance \\n\\nbefore coming to (inaudible) so they had sort of a -- 16, 18 months to already start \\n\\ngetting the ball ready.    They knew.    Now, we\\'re at a -- you know, a year into the \\n\\ncase now almost and they\\'re saying they need until December 1 to figure out what \\n\\nevidence they want to adduce and how they want to adduce it with these particular \\n\\nwitnesses knowing that the universe of witnesses is rather small.    I empathise with \\n\\nthem, I sympathise with them, my heart goes out to them, but I also have a very small \\n\\nteam.    And if we want to start on time, because your initial question was, why do I \\n\\nneed three months?    Well, the later I get this information, the more pressure it is on \\n\\n24.09.2021 \\n\\nPage 18 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-048-Red-ENG WT 24-09-2021 19/32 SZ T\\n\\nStatus Conference                                              (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/15 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nthe Defence.    We want to have a fair trial.    We\\'re not trying to take -- take advantage \\n\\nof the Prosecution, you know.    We\\'re not that clever.    But they\\'re clever enough and \\n\\nthey have the resources enough to -- to provide that information.    And the sooner \\n\\nthat we get it, the sooner the battle -- because that\\'s -- there are going to be some battle \\n\\nroyales over that material.    I can assure the Trial Chamber.    We\\'re not just going to \\n\\ngo quietly into the midnight.    We\\'re going to fight that and those submissions will \\n\\nrequire sufficient time for preparation and sufficient time for your Honour to go \\n\\nthrough them.    And it\\'s important -- these are important matters that should not wait \\n\\nuntil the very end.    Thank you. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:16:48] Thank you very much, Mr Karnavas. \\n\\nThe next topic is the issue of additional witnesses.    And this is a question again for \\n\\nthe Prosecution.    From the filings, it seems that the Defence does not have the \\n\\nidentity of additional witnesses the Prosecution is currently considering to call.   \\n\\nThey don\\'t have that identity yet.    I\\'m looking at paragraph 35 of the written \\n\\nsubmissions, Mr Steynberg.    And is this -- is this correct?    Is that the position? \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [10:17:30] Indeed, your Honour, that is the position.    And, again, \\n\\nI\\'m mindful that we\\'re in public session.    But as foreshadowed in the filing, the \\n\\nidentities of these witnesses cannot be disclosed until the necessary security measures \\n\\nhave been put in place. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:17:46] But do you concede that you have a \\n\\ndisclosure obligation to the Defence even if you decide not to call these persons under \\n\\nRule 77?   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [10:18:05] Your Honour, that\\'s something I\\'d like to take under \\n\\nconsideration, if I may.    I think that will require some further thought.    It may well \\n\\nbe.    I don\\'t want to say no, but I would have to certainly consider what obligations \\n\\n24.09.2021 \\n\\nPage 19 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-048-Red-ENG WT 24-09-2021 20/32 SZ T\\n\\nStatus Conference                                              (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/15 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nthe Prosecution has.    And then if the conclusion is that we have such an obligation, \\n\\nwhich we may well have, then consider whether or not the Chamber would need to \\n\\nbe approached if such disclosure might cause -- put the witnesses as risk. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:18:45] While you\\'re still on your legs, \\n\\nMr Steynberg, yes.    The position, I believe, is that you have that obligation to \\n\\ndisclose to the other side, to the Defence.    If you consider that there exists a \\n\\ndisclosure obligation, why do you submit in your filing that you liaise with the VWS \\n\\nconcerning these witnesses only when you have made a decision to call them?   \\n\\nWouldn\\'t it be more efficient to do this sooner?    If there be any need for \\n\\nnon-standard redactions particularly pertaining to the witnesses\\' identity, the \\n\\nChamber will want to have an assessment from VWS in any event. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [10:19:32] The -- I take the Chamber\\'s views to heart.    Obviously, \\n\\nwhat I think really doesn\\'t matter if those are the Chamber\\'s views.     \\n\\nYes, your Honour, I think it would certainly be prudent to perhaps start those \\n\\ndiscussions as soon as possible.    Obviously, it -- you know, it really depends, again, \\n\\nwhat the witness says.    If we meet with the witness and they tell us, sorry, we know \\n\\nnothing about this incident, we don\\'t know the accused and we have no information \\n\\nto provide you, that is a relevant factor to take into account, I think, when -- when \\n\\nconsidering whether disclosure is necessary.     \\n\\nOn the other hand, if the witness gives exonerating evidence, that\\'s of course also \\n\\nvery relevant and would impact heavily on any decision that the Prosecution might \\n\\nmake.    If the witness says, well, I don\\'t want to cooperate with you or simply doesn\\'t \\n\\nrespond to our communications, well, that\\'s another situation which must be taken \\n\\ninto account.    But, your Honour, I take your Honours admonitions to heart and we \\n\\nwill approach the VWS to discuss these issues.    I may add that the Prosecution also \\n\\n24.09.2021 \\n\\nPage 20 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-048-Red-ENG WT 24-09-2021 21/32 SZ T\\n\\nStatus Conference                                              (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/15 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nhas its own internal protection strategies unit who are also experts in witness \\n\\nprotection, and we do liaise with them weekly certainly to discuss witness security \\n\\nissues.    But independent views of the VWS may certainly be helpful to the Chamber. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:21:19] Sorry.    Mr Steynberg, I\\'m sorry.    When \\n\\nare you meeting the witness?    Do you have a date planned? \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [10:21:28] Yes, your Honour.    I do have a date planned, but I \\n\\nregret that this is certainly not an issue I would want to discuss in public and indeed \\n\\nnot an issue I\\'d want to discuss inter partes.    I do believe that I have indicated in an ex \\n\\nparte e-mail communication with the Chamber on the issue of -- of certain redactions \\n\\nrelated to witnesses the reasons why it would not be prudent to foreshadow exactly \\n\\nwhen interviews are to happen since this may lead to identification of witnesses. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:22:12] I thank you very much.    The next item on \\n\\nthe list are agreements as to evidence pursuant to Rule 69 of the Rules.    May I, as a \\n\\ngeneral comment, say that there is no deadline in order to reach an agreement on facts.   \\n\\nHowever, obviously, in order to have the biggest effects on the expeditiousness of the \\n\\nproceedings, such agreement should ideally be reached before the Prosecution \\n\\npresents its evidence.    The Prosecution informed the Chamber that the discussions \\n\\non this matter between the parties are ongoing. \\n\\nCan you kindly provide an update, Mr Steynberg?   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [10:23:01] Yes, your Honour.    Well, I don\\'t think there\\'s been \\n\\nvery much to update your Honour on.    Prior to -- shortly prior to the filing of the \\n\\nProsecution\\'s submissions, and after an initial inter partes meeting to discuss various \\n\\nissues on which agreement might be reached, the Prosecution provided the Defence \\n\\nwith its, should we say, wish list of items which we believe are items on which \\n\\nagreement may be reached, items which we believe are established by objective \\n\\n24.09.2021 \\n\\nPage 21 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-048-Red-ENG WT 24-09-2021 22/32 SZ T\\n\\nStatus Conference                                              (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/15 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nevidence and may be accepted by the Defence.    But, of course, the Defence have their \\n\\nown duties to -- to the accused and notwithstanding their willingness to discuss these \\n\\nissues and to cooperate, ultimately they will put their client first, I\\'m sure. \\n\\nSo the current status is that the request is with the Defence.    We are awaiting any \\n\\nresponse from them.    But, again, there have been other urgent pressing issues in the \\n\\ninterim, and I\\'m sure that they will get back to the Prosecution at the earliest \\n\\nopportunity. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:24:20] Thank you very much, Mr Steynberg. \\n\\nDoes the Defence have anything to say or add?    Do you envisage the possibility of \\n\\nagreeing to some of the facts that are alleged by the Prosecution or will you be \\n\\ncontesting everything?    This is obviously your prerogative, Mr Karnavas, but it \\n\\nwould be highly desirable or appreciated if it would be possible to focus this trial on \\n\\nthose issues that are truly contested.    In order to achieve efficiency and expedition of \\n\\na trial, there must be inter alia and only identification of the real issues which are in \\n\\nthe case and a greater use of agreed facts between the parties.    Can I hear you on that, \\n\\nMr Karnavas? \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:25:12] You certainly may, your Honour.    I couldn\\'t agree \\n\\nwith you more on that.    You know, facts that are notorious that you can take judicial \\n\\nnotice of, obviously, you don\\'t need to hear -- or the Prosecution doesn\\'t need to hear \\n\\nfrom the Defence such as that Nairobi is in Kenya.    Okay.    We know that.    There \\n\\nare some other facts that we might be able to agree with.    My -- what I intend to do is \\n\\nI intend to sit down with the gentleman.    I would prefer doing it that way, sitting \\n\\ndown and going one by one.    And to the extent that we can agree to certain things, \\n\\nwe will.    It is not my intention to make the Prosecutor prove that, for instance, today \\n\\nis Friday.    That\\'s a notorious fact.    I don\\'t intend to take up the Court\\'s time by \\n\\n24.09.2021 \\n\\nPage 22 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-048-Red-ENG WT 24-09-2021 23/32 SZ T\\n\\nStatus Conference                                              (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/15 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nforcing the Prosecutor to prove things that are not necessarily relevant.    It wouldn\\'t \\n\\nbe fair to the court.    It\\'s not fair to the Prosecution.    It\\'s not fair to the process.    It \\n\\ndoesn\\'t help the case in any event.     \\n\\nSo I won\\'t be disputatious for the purpose of being disputatious, but there are some \\n\\nfacts that we might for various reasons require the Prosecutor to lay a foundation, to \\n\\nput them to the test.    But I can assure the Trial Chamber that we\\'re going to do our \\n\\nlevel best to agree to as many facts as is possible, keeping in mind that we have an \\n\\nobligation to Mr Gicheru.    That\\'s why we\\'re here.    And we\\'re not going -- I\\'m not \\n\\ngoing to try to make his job easier.    I can assure you of that.    But we will -- we won\\'t \\n\\ntake up unnecessary court time on fighting facts that are relatively agreeable by both \\n\\nsides.    Thank you. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:27:16] Thank you very much, Mr Karnavas.    As I \\n\\nsaid, that\\'s your prerogative, but if you could agree on facts that would help the \\n\\nproceedings very much.     \\n\\nIn its order on this status conference, the Chamber asked the parties to make \\n\\nsubmissions on the opening statements.     \\n\\nFirst, I note that the Prosecution, in paragraph 44 of its submissions, stated that it \\n\\nwould request time to respond to the Defence\\'s opening statement should the Defence \\n\\nchoose to make them at the beginning of the trial.    This proposal might stem from a \\n\\nmisunderstanding of the purpose of opening statements.    Opening statements are \\n\\nnot evidence or submissions by the parties on a discreet issue.    They provide the \\n\\nopportunity for the parties to succinctly present their case to the Chamber.   \\n\\nAccordingly, no response to an opening statement will be granted.    So with this \\n\\nclarification, the Chamber notes that the Defence has not made any submissions on \\n\\nthis issue.    Could I kindly ask Mr Karnavas to present your view? \\n\\n24.09.2021 \\n\\nPage 23 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-048-Red-ENG WT 24-09-2021 24/32 SZ T\\n\\nStatus Conference                                              (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/15 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:28:35] Thank you, your Honour.    And you took the thunder \\n\\nfrom my argument.    I precisely agree with you with respect to the purpose of \\n\\nopening statements and that absolutely under no circumstances should there be a \\n\\nresponse to that.    Our position is as follows: We will know what we will do after we \\n\\nhear the Prosecution\\'s case.    I don\\'t see the point in -- they ask for two hours.   \\n\\nFrankly, I think two hours is far too much.    I think they can do so in 30 minutes.    A \\n\\ngood opening statement should just tell the Court what the evidence intends to show \\n\\nso that the Court has a pretty good indication.    But if they need two hours, if they \\n\\nwant four hours, if they want ten hours, that\\'s fine with them.    As far as our -- we\\'re \\n\\nconcerned, we will hear what they have to say.    By that point, we\\'ll pretty much \\n\\nknow.    I certainly will inform the Court well in advance.    If were to -- to give an \\n\\nopening statement, I can assure the Court, having been warned by one of my \\n\\nfavourite judges in the United States that he would only listen to 15 minutes of any \\n\\nargument that I would make, but that I could talk as long as I want, my indication is \\n\\nmore than 15 minutes is superfluous.    So were I to give one, it would be in that range.   \\n\\nThank you. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:30:11] Thank you very much, Mr Karnavas.    I\\'m \\n\\nsure we\\'ll give a decision as to timing - two hours, four hours, as you say, 15 \\n\\nminutes - when we give out the decision. \\n\\nDoes the Prosecution wish to add anything, Mr Steynberg, in respect of opening \\n\\nstatements?   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [10:30:27] No, your Honour.    Only to observe that the \\n\\nProsecution said it would require no more than two hours.    That was the absolute \\n\\ntop.    We probably won\\'t use two hours, but I prefer to err on the side of caution. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:30:48] All right.

I also note that the Defence has not made any submissions on the \\n\\nissue of a trial brief.    I am aware of the view that it would assist everyone in this case \\n\\nif a trial brief could be filed before the trial starts so that we all have an idea of what \\n\\nthe real issues are in this case and what the Defence is going to be in general terms.   \\n\\nOf course, the Chamber does not expect the Defence to provide the complete detail of \\n\\nthe Defence, certainly not at this stage.    Similarly, the provision of such a brief does \\n\\nnot preclude you from adding other avenues at a later stage if those become evident \\n\\nto you.    However, the Chamber is of the view that it would be a good idea in order \\n\\nto determine what the issues are in this case. \\n\\nCould I kindly ask the Defence to present their views on this?   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:32:07] Certainly, your Honour.     \\n\\nI\\'ve been at this business for about 40 years.    Never in my 40 years have I alerted the \\n\\nProsecution or the Court of my views on the Defence prior to the Prosecution meeting \\n\\nits burden of proof in their case-in-chief.     \\n\\nNow, in my previous cases before other international tribunals, I have managed to \\n\\nstretch my trial brief to about a page and a half.    That would include also the \\n\\nsignature line.    I don\\'t mean to be facetious, but my position is no quarter sought, \\n\\nnone given.    The Prosecution has to prove its case.    And if we do intend to put on a \\n\\nDefence, we will do so through our cross-examination, of course, through -- during \\n\\ntheir case-in-chief and then we will decide to what extent any witnesses will be called \\n\\non our behalf.    But be that as it may, I can answer very quickly.    Our trial brief will \\n\\nbe such as:    We contest all relevant facts on all Counts.    We find that Mr Gicheru \\n\\n24.09.2021 \\n\\nPage 25 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-048-Red-ENG WT 24-09-2021 26/32 SZ T\\n\\nStatus Conference                                              (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/15 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nshould not be prosecuted before this Tribunal and that we deny all allegations.     \\n\\nSo that\\'s our trial brief, your Honour.    And were I to put it in writing, that\\'s what I \\n\\nwould put in.    I\\'m being very, very honest with you.    I don\\'t -- I see no reason to \\n\\nhold anything back.    And I don\\'t -- I mean no disrespect.    As I said, this is not a very \\n\\ncomplicated case, but even if it were I would basically say the same thing.    The \\n\\nProsecutor has a burden.    They purposely wrote the document containing the \\n\\ncharges the way they wanted to write it.    They have that authority, they have that \\n\\npower.    I have no power.    You have discretion.    All I have is what little rules and \\n\\nstatute allow me to do here.    And so -- but we do have one thing and that is the \\n\\nProsecution has the burden of proof.    They have to meet their burden of proof.    We \\n\\nhave the presumption of innocence, so I\\'ll leave it at that, your Honour. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:34:33] Well, thank you very much, Mr Karnavas. \\n\\nThe next agenda item is the matter of translation during the proceedings.    The \\n\\nProsecution indicated in paragraph 25 of its submissions that there were problems \\n\\nwith the interpretation between English and Swahili due to the fact that this was done \\n\\nvia French.    The Chamber also notes the submissions by the Registry on the matter \\n\\nof interpretation and that they will be able to provide interpretation for Swahili. \\n\\nNow, with the Prosecution\\'s comments in mind, could the Registry shortly confirm \\n\\nthat the interpretation will be done from Swahili directly into the English and provide \\n\\nany other necessary information?     \\n\\nRegistry, please. \\n\\nMR ZANEN:    [10:35:38] Yes, your Honour.    Thank you for your question.     \\n\\nWith regards to the observations of the Prosecution and Swahili -- sorry.    I\\'ll be more \\n\\nunderstandable if I take this off.     \\n\\nWith regards to the -- to the relay interpretation from Swahili into French via French \\n\\n24.09.2021 \\n\\nPage 26 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-048-Red-ENG WT 24-09-2021 27/32 SZ T\\n\\nStatus Conference                                              (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/15 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\ninto English, that is an option, but indeed we will be able to provide the interpretation \\n\\nfrom Swahili directly into English.    It will require some effort on our part given that \\n\\nwe depend to some extent on external resources, but we will probably have sufficient \\n\\ntime to make that arrangement.    So we foresee, in principle, no issue with providing \\n\\nthe interpretation from Swahili and vice versa into English for this case.     \\n\\nOther than that, just as today to support the hearings French/English simultaneous \\n\\ninterpretation will be provided, the interpretation Swahili/English will in principle \\n\\nalso be simultaneous.    And I\\'m saying this simultaneous in the hearings because \\n\\nwe\\'ve had in the past -- had other languages for other situations in which the \\n\\ninterpretation had to be consecutive when there are no professional interpreters for \\n\\nthat language.    But as far as our understanding at this point in time, that\\'s not the \\n\\ncase. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:37:17] Thank you very much.    Does the \\n\\nProsecution have anything to add or bring to the Registry\\'s attention?   \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [10:37:24] Only to say that I\\'m grateful to my Registry colleagues \\n\\nfor their cooperation on this issue.    I have also had some separate communications \\n\\nwith Mr Diederick\\'s colleague on this issue, and I did indicate to her that, you know, \\n\\nit was not only the relayed interpretation that was the issue, but it was also the issue \\n\\nof the dialect of Swahili that was spoken by the francophone Swahili interpreters.    I \\n\\nunderstand there are some significant regional variations in Swahili, particularly \\n\\nbetween that spoken in the DRC and that spoken, on the other hand, in Kenya and \\n\\nTanzania.    So the Prosecution has suggested and my colleagues have confirmed that \\n\\nthey will attempt to obtain interpreters that speak the same dialect of Swahili which \\n\\nwill facilitate, we believe, the interpretation in this case. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:38:32] Thank you very much, Mr Steynberg. \\n\\n24.09.2021 \\n\\nPage 27 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cStatus Conference                                              (Private Session)                                              ICC-01/09-01/15 \\n\\nICC-01/09-01/20-T-048-Red-ENG WT 24-09-2021 28/32 SZ T\\n\\nMr Karnavas, do you have anything to say?   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:38:35] I have nothing to add, but I totally agree with the \\n\\nProsecution concerning the dialect issue.

This is not something that has \\n\\nreceived proper briefing yet, but I just wanted to mention that, your Honour, because \\n\\ndecisions like this will have implications for decisions the Prosecution might take in \\n\\nterms of how it intends to lead its case, how it intends to provide documentary \\n\\nevidence to the Court.    And the sooner we have clarity, the more efficient it would \\n\\nbe for our preparations. \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:43:44] Well, that was not on the -- it was not on the \\n\\nagenda for today -- for today\\'s status conference, unless the other party is ready to \\n\\naddress this matter orally?    Do you have anything to say, Mr Karnavas?   \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:44:02] Yes, your Honour.    I\\'m ready.    Should I go? \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:44:10] Oh, yes, please. \\n\\nMR KARNAVAS:    [10:44:11] On paragraph 55, I believe, is where the Prosecution \\n\\nmakes this -- makes its submissions.     \\n\\nI come from a common law system.    I\\'m very well familiar with the civil law system \\n\\nwhere everything comes in and you sort of sift it out at the end.    I\\'m not a big fan of \\n\\nthat.    I understand it\\'s okay in some large cases, and also it allows the Trial Chamber \\n\\nto make a determination on what is and what is not relevant and then to decide, in \\n\\nconjunction with everything else that it has heard and has been adduced, how much \\n\\nweight to give to the evidence.    However, I think that in a small case such as this one, \\n\\nand depending on the filings that we get concerning what they tried to admit, I think \\n\\nit\\'s important that as the evidence comes in that there\\'s some kind of a screening \\n\\nprocess as opposed to just letting it all in and then trying to figure out at the end.   \\n\\n24.09.2021 \\n\\nPage 30 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-048-Red-ENG WT 24-09-2021 31/32 SZ T\\n\\nStatus Conference                                              (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/15 \\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n5 \\n\\n6 \\n\\n7 \\n\\n8 \\n\\n9 \\n\\n10 \\n\\n11 \\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 \\n\\n14 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n16 \\n\\n17 \\n\\n18 \\n\\n19 \\n\\n20 \\n\\n21 \\n\\n22 \\n\\n23 \\n\\n24 \\n\\n25 \\n\\nThe Prosecution claims that this is a more efficient process.    I dare say it is not.    Of \\n\\ncourse, a lot of these issues can be dealt with in a written fashion.    So to the extent \\n\\nthat a lot of the evidence can be sifted through for admissibility, as far as I\\'m \\n\\nconcerned, that\\'s -- you know, even though it\\'s a low threshold, we\\'re looking at \\n\\nrelevance, reliability, authenticity.    The Prosecution is going to have to, at least with \\n\\nsome of the evidence, establish a proper foundation to make sure that the evidence, \\n\\nyou know, is reliable and also that the witness is competent to testify about the \\n\\nparticular evidence.    So I don\\'t see that we gain that much time by just letting it all in \\n\\nand then, you know, having the Trial Chamber sort of sift through it at the very end \\n\\nand figure out and try to make sense of it all.    So that\\'s my position, your Honour.   \\n\\nThank you. \\n\\nMR STEYNBERG:    [10:46:23] If I may, briefly, your Honour.     \\n\\nThe Prosecution does also not take a strong position on this issue.    I, like my learned \\n\\nfriend, am also from a common law jurisdiction and I am used to -- to this issue and \\n\\naddressing the issue of admissibility during the proceedings.    But from my prior \\n\\nexperience in these proceedings, it does seem that it takes an inordinate amount of \\n\\ntime, courtroom time during the course of leading witnesses if every time a document \\n\\nis produced there is an argument about whether or not that document must go in.   \\n\\nThese arguments can go on for five, ten, 15 minutes and there are often several.    As \\n\\nmy learned friend said, this is a fairly circumscribed case, no more than 16 witnesses, \\n\\nand I think there\\'s a real danger that we might spend more time arguing over \\n\\ndocuments than listening to evidence.     \\n\\nBut, your Honour, I leave this in the Chamber\\'s hands.    My only observation is that \\n\\nbeing an Article 70 case, we should look to follow the most expeditious procedure \\n\\npossible.    I\\'ll say no more on the issue. \\n\\n24.09.2021 \\n\\nPage 31 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cICC-01/09-01/20-T-048-Red-ENG WT 24-09-2021 32/32 SZ T\\n\\nStatus Conference                                              (Open Session)                                                ICC-01/09-01/15 \\n\\nPRESIDING JUDGE SAMBA:    [10:47:37] Well, thank you very much, Counsel.
